We, Populi, Inc., (&#8220;Populi&#8221;) provide our college management system and related services through our website located at www.populiweb.com (our &#8220;Site&#8221;) and our mobile device applications (&#8220;Apps&#8221;). We also make our system and related services available through our customers&#8217; websites (&#8220;Customer Sites&#8221;). Please read these Terms carefully because they govern your use of our Services (as defined below).

                &#8220;Plain-language&#8221; summaries (<em>&#8220;This means that&#8230;&#8221;</em> sections) are provided for your convenience and are not legally binding.

                    By signing up your school for a Populi Customer Account, you bind your school to the terms described in these Customer Terms of Service (CTOS). Sometimes we&#8217;ll update Populi, and these CTOS covers those updates, too. We may also need to update these CTOS, and we&#8217;ll let you know when we do. Additionally, these CTOS bind anyone at your school who uses Populi to our Authorized Use Policy (AUP).

                1.1 About these Terms:

                Use of our Services by our Customers&#8217; Authorized Users is governed by our Acceptable Use Policy. A Customer&#8217;s &#8220;Authorized Users&#8221; are persons who have been granted access by the Customer to access and use the Services via a unique login (a username and password). Authorized Users include:

            </h5>            
            <p>
                By establishing a Customer Account (as defined below), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don&#8217;t agree to these Terms, do not use the Services. You are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or education institution (such as your employer) or other legal entity, and consequently you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. &#8220;You&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221; will refer to that company or other legal entity.

            </h5>
            <p>
                We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we&#8217;ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It&#8217;s important that you review the modified Terms because if you continue to use the Services after we&#8217;ve let you know that the Terms have been modified, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don&#8217;t agree to be bound by the modified Terms then you may no longer use the Services.

                <p>
                    So your school can use Populi, you need to set up a Populi Customer Account. Your users will need to have Populi User Accounts in order to use Populi.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                To use the Services, including enabling us to implement and operate your instance of the Services, you&#8217;ll have to create a Populi customer account (your &#8220;Customer Account&#8221;). To create a Customer Account, you must complete the Populi Customer Account Signup process.
            </p>    
            <p>    
                In addition, each of your Authorized Users will have to create a unique Populi user account to use certain features of the Services, including
                the Populi section of your Customer Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of the Customer Account signup process, and from time to time via the Services, you will designate one or more of your Authorized Users as your &#8220;Account Admin(s)&#8221; or &#8220;Billing Contact(s)&#8221;. &#8220;Account Admins&#8221; can access and manage all aspects of your Customer Account and your Customer Content (defined below)<!--via the &#8220;Account&#8221; section of the Customer Site/!-->. "Billing Contacts" (and others whom you may specify) will be notified concerning invoices for payments owed to Populi.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree and acknowledge that each user login may only be used by one (1) person and sharing of user logins (including passwords) is not
                permitted. You may create separate logins, and designate as many Authorized Users as are necessary for the effective use of the Services. You
                will not create a login to the Services for, or otherwise provide access to the Services to, any representative(s) of any competing software
                distributor or vendor.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to maintain our own logins and user accounts for your Customer Site in order to provide the Services, including to assist
                with your support requests.
