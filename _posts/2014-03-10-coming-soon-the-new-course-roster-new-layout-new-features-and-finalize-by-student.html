<p>Now simmering in the Populi kitchen: a new, updated course roster.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/88405399?byline=0&amp;portrait=0" height="346" width="615" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The current roster is a good, workaday tool that does the job for a lot of our users. It lets you manage course enrollment information—everything from student status to attendance hours—and gives you some simple group contact/export options. At the same time, it has a lot of room for improvement. The layout has gotten cramped over the years. Enrolling more than a few students at a time is a chore. And you can't really work with a specific subset of students—for example, there's no way to quickly contact, say, the course auditors (without also contacting everyone else, too).</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-6-14-ROSTER-POWER.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2621" alt="3-6-14 ROSTER POWER" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-6-14-ROSTER-POWER.png" width="615" height="345" /></a></p>
<p>To tackle these problems, the new Roster introduces a new layout and some helpful new features while also preserving all your existing workflows.</p>
<h5>Enrollment status</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-06-at-4.48.49-PM.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2622" style="" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-06 at 4.48.49 PM" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-06-at-4.48.49-PM.png" width="366" height="196" /></a></p>
<p>The status<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> column replaces the old roster’s Status panels. The new drop-down at the top filters the roster to show students of a particular status.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-edit-manage.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2623" style="" alt="3-7-14 edit manage" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-edit-manage.png" width="259" height="215" /></a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Changing a status or leaving a note is simple as ever—just click the appropriate icon and go for it.</span></p>
<h5>Adding students</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-add-students.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2624" style="" alt="3-7-14 add students" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-add-students.png" width="430" height="126" /></a></p>
<p>The new roster gives you two options for enrolling students: add them by name or import them from another course. Adding by name lets you search for and select multiple students; when importing students, you simply choose the term and the course and check the students you want to import.  Both options make it much simpler to, for example, bulk-enroll a specific cohort of students—all in about a minute.</p>
<h5>Subsets of students</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-actions-menu.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2625" style="" alt="3-7-14 actions menu" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-actions-menu.png" width="268" height="254" /></a></p>
<p>You can also perform certain actions with a subset of students. Just check the boxes next to the students you want to include and click Actions. You’ll see new options to email <em>selected</em> students and export <em>selected</em> students.</p>
<h5>Multiple course names on one roster</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-multiple-courses.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2627" alt="3-7-14 multiple courses" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-multiple-courses.png" width="610" height="397" /></a></p>
<p>Oftentimes, you’ll offer the same catalog course to the same group of students, with each student needing something different on his transcript. For example, you might have a general “Directed Study” course, with one student studying guitar and another taking piano. Previously, you had to create separate sections with different course names for each student, and then manage multiple rosters. Now, you can just create additional course names and descriptions on the Roster for specific students.</p>
<h5>Finalize by student</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-finalize-course.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2628" alt="3-7-14 finalize course" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/03/3-7-14-finalize-course.png" width="610" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, course finalization.* With the new release, you’ll be able to finalize individual students while leaving the course in progress for everyone else. You'll still be able to finalize the course and all students at once... but you won't <em>have to</em>.</p>
<h5>Coming to Populi in about a couple weeks</h5>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The new roster gives you a lot more flexibility with course management and we're excited to get it out there. It's still a couple weeks out, give or take, but once we've corrected the seasoning, we'll be dishing it up to everyone.</span></p>
