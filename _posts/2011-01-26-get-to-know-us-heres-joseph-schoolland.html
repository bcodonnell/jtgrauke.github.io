<p>Joseph Schoolland's laugh is startling. It's a brash, booming thing with the cadence of a chuckle and the rustic timbre of the farmyard. Small children duck and cover when Joseph's laugh stampedes through the room. It's an unapologetic, unashamed, satisfied <em>laugh</em>, and it fits the man perfectly. A straight-shooting Dutchman, he says what he thinks and keeps it simple and clear. But far from being some sort of no-nonsense ramrod, he has proved an endless source of dopey YouTube videos and remains the only one here who still thinks we need an official office unicycle.</p>

<p>And, of course, he's a fine salesman. Joseph spends his workdays introducing potential customers to Populi—not just the software, but also the company and <a href="http://populi.co/about/">its approach</a>. "Purchasing software takes time and thought, and my job is to make it easy for prospective clients. The sales process should develop a relationship: prospective clients are honest about their needs and I'm honest about whether Populi can help them. Schools have enough to do just keeping up with the day's tasks—never mind sorting through a bunch of vendors. So, whether or not a school goes with Populi, I want to make their decision easy." Even after making a sale, Joseph is an important part of Populi's ongoing relationship with the customer, checking in with them to see how the tool is working out and if there's anything else he can do to help them. Since our business plan essentially requires us to win back our customers <a href="http://populi.co/pricing/"><strong>every month</strong></a>, it seems that Joseph is on to something.</p>
<p>With a work history that includes residential construction and building molds for yachts and Boeings in <a href="http://www.janicki.com/">Northwest Washington</a>, Joseph has settled into sales for the past seven years—long enough, he says, "to unlearn the obnoxious, strong-arm tactics" endemic to the profession. Those years saw him plying cutlery in Washington, security systems in Texas, real estate in Idaho, and economic data around the United States for Populi's one-time parent company, EMSI. For the past four years, he has also been pursuing his Bachelor of Arts at New Saint Andrews College; he should have it four short months from now. Joseph has been with Populi since January 2010, and besides his invaluable service to the company in bringing on new customers, he's also proven plenty willing to grab the last appetizer on the platter during our weekly Friday company meetings—a potentially awkward task that can require some social mettle.</p>
<p>The man is fiercely devoted to his wife Sarah, an artist and an avid cook. "She actually reads <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Cooking-Science-Lore-Kitchen/dp/0684800012/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295910886&amp;sr=8-1"><em>On Food and Cooking</em></a></strong> by Harold McGee—for fun. She really loves bread and how it does what it does, its history, and she's even thought about teaching a class about it. Me? I love her bread because she's <em>sooo</em> good at it," gushed Joseph, "I don't think we've ever had store-bought bread in our house." Joseph and Sarah are in the thick of the adoption process for their first child, an infant to be born somewhere in the U.S. "We're still on the waiting list, but we've been told that it can happen pretty quickly once a birth mom chooses us."</p>
<p>If the Schoollands have their way, the little one will grow up in a house full of Joseph's laugh, ukelele tunes, stacks of books, Sarah's artwork, and buttered slices of her artisan bread. Said house would be somewhere just outside of town. "I dream about getting some land and raising beef cows, goats, chickens, pigeons, rabbits," said Joseph, who grew up on a dairy and then on a fish hatchery. "Oh, yeah, and I'd also like to figure out how to raise tilapia in cold northern Idaho. I'd enjoy any of it, really. We'll see what I get to do."</p>
<h5>Update: Thursday, September 29...</h5>
<p>Joseph and Sarah have just signed the official paperwork and are now the overjoyed parents of Thaddeus Grant Schoolland!</p>
