<p>Nick Holloway and Joseph Schoolland are at the <a href="http://www.abhe.org/"><strong>Association for Biblical Higher Education's</strong></a><strong> </strong>63rd Annual Meeting in <strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>. If you're there, too, drop by Booth 705 in the Exhibitor's Hall. Say hello, grab some fliers (including <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Populi-Accreditation.pdf"><strong>this bit</strong></a> on Accreditation), and maybe drop off a business card for a shot at <strong>an iTunes gift card.</strong></p>
<p>After that, they'll be tooling around in the Southeastern U.S., visiting friends and colleges, and finally making their way back to <strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong> for the <strong><a href="http://www.cccu.org/">Council for Christian Colleges and Universities</a></strong>' International Forum on Christian Higher Education. The International Forum meets every four years; this one's called <a href="http://www.cccu.org/forum/overview"><strong>Critical Breakthroughs</strong></a>. You'll find Nick and Joseph (and some more iTunes cards) in the Exhibitor's Hall <strong>in Booth 200</strong>.</p>
