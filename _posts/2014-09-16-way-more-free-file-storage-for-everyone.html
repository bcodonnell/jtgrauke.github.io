<p><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2014/04/even-more-free-file-storage-for-everyone/">April 7, 2014</a>.</p>
<p>Today.</p>
<p>Doing what we do best, we're pleased to announce that we've yet again given everyone more free file storage. Have a gander at our <a href="http://populi.co/pricing/">Pricing page</a> if you don't believe us.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Small</strong> plan just got a little less small with 1,000—count 'em: one <em>thousand</em>—free gigabytes of file storage.</li>
<li>The <strong>Medium</strong> plan is even medium-er with 2,000 free gigs of file storage.</li>
<li>And the <strong>Large</strong> plan? Yup, it's now larger: 3,000 gee-bees of file storage, included free.</li>
<li>If you manage to go over your limit, additional storage costs just 10 cents per gigabyte per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you used to pay for storage above your plan's limit, you're probably paying <em>nothing</em> for those files now. And if you've been holding back from uploading files for fear of passing your limit, well, fear no longer—each plan has <em>a lot</em> of free storage.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, you can do a lot of stuff with files. You can <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/file-storage-and-streaming-media/">embed audio and video files</a> in your courses so your students can <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/12/feature-spotlight-video-encoding/">stream them anywhere</a> on almost any device. Faculty and students can upload and exchange assignment files—and instructors can even <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2014/07/new-course-and-gradebook-features/">annotate documents</a> with feedback. Plus there's all the humdrum stuff—files in the Activity Feed, the Files app, profile pictures, application files... and so on.</p>
<p>Since files are such an important part of how our customers use Populi, we're happy to give everyone more opportunity to take full advantage of the functionality—without having to pay extra.</p>
