<p>Course registration is about to get a big upgrade. Here's a look at what's coming...</p>

<p>But first, let&#8217;s have a quick look at the current registration screen and some of the problems we wanted to solve.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>It shows a dense list of available courses together with some salient details: schedule, faculty, number of openings, and so forth. Courses available for enrollment are intermixed with those for auditing; courses for which students cannot register are just as prominent as the ones for which they can. Finally, there&#8217;s no way to get on a course waitlist, nor is there any way to indicate courses the student would like to drop in case a spot opens up.</p>

<p>The new features improve the registration process on all these points.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>There are two sections: <em>Offered Courses</em> and <em>Selected Courses</em>. <em>Offered</em> defaults to show only <em>Available courses without conflicts</em>&mdash;that is, courses in which the student may enroll. It excludes courses from other programs, those with conflicts (schedule, prerequisites, term enrollment limits), and those not offered on the student&#8217;s campuses. Students can also look at <em>Available courses</em> (which may have conflicts) and <em>All courses</em> (which may include courses in which they cannot enroll).</p>

</p>

<p>Each course offering has more information&mdash;whether the student has already passed it, how many openings (enrolled and auditing), and what conflicts exist.</p>

</p>

<p>The screen lets registrants toggle between courses for enrollment and auditing.</p>

</p>

<p>To register, the student clicks the green plus sign. This creates an enrollment request that, when confirmed, appears under <em>Selected Courses</em>. As <em>Selected</em> fills up, <em>Offered</em> instantly updates to show what&#8217;s still available that works with the student&#8217;s schedule and other constraints. Once the student has selected all the courses she&#8217;s after, she&#8217;ll Save to submit the requests.</p>

</p>

<p>Finally, the new &#8220;Waitlist Over-enrollment&#8221; feature will take a huge load off your waitlist workload. Once enabled in Academics &gt; Settings, students can click the clock to request the next spot on that course&#8217;s waiting list. When she saves, Populi will check to see whether the waitlisted course conflicts with a term enrollment limit or the student&#8217;s schedule. If that&#8217;s the case, she&#8217;ll be able to choose which courses she&#8217;s willing to drop if a spot opens up. Should that happen, Populi will automatically drop as many of the chosen courses as necessary to move her off the waitlist and onto the rolls.</p>

<p>Lord willing and the creeks don&#8217;t rise, we&#8217;re planning to have the new registration features out to all our customers the third week of October.</p>
