<p>Populi (NASDACK:LOLZ) has agreed to be acquired by Blackborad (NYYYSE:BLOB), whose president, Larry, says is a giant education software company with deep pockets. The terms of the deal include Blackborad swapping a solid-gold yacht to Populi's majority shareholders in a deal valued well north of $4,500, sources say.<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/4-1-12-gold-yacht.jpg"><img style="margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;" title="4-1-12 gold yacht" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/4-1-12-gold-yacht.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>"We're really excited about the synergies moving forward," said Isaac Grauke, CEO. "Blackborad's team has a great approach to whatever it is they do, and we think we can implement some robust optimizations as we integrate our core vertices. Our customers really have a lot to look forward to—and not just because Christmas is coming in only eight more months."</p>
<p>Upon accepting the offer, Populi was visited by Blackborad's elite masked acquisition team, who pored over the young company's operations and records in search of best-of-breed synergies. "The Populi guys weren't sure where their synergies were," said Larry in a prepared statement. "They thought they might be in a mini-fridge they never opened, but when we checked that, it turned out a family of possums had occupied it. But we remain confident that our experienced executive team can nevertheless wring a lot out of this company."</p>
<p>Larry's statement was accompanied by a preliminary list of synergies and new protocols for monotonectally reconceptualizing extensive deliverables, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer support will be outsourced to the eleven wives of Mormon separatist Clive "Sugarpop" Brigham of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.44338,-111.232688&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=17">38.44338,-111.232688, Utah</a>.</li>
<li>Development has been outsourced to the entire nation of Yemen.</li>
<li>Everything will be integrated with Facebook. Just, everything—FERPA be damned.</li>
<li>Isaac Grauke will have to wear a Marilyn Monroe wig if Populi doesn't meet certain year-end performance goals.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thomaskinkade.com/magi/servlet/com.asucon.ebiz.promo.web.tk.PromoServlet?promoAction=nr&amp;abbr=littlemermaid">Thomas Kinkade</a> will be retained to craft a warmer, less-threatening Flash-based interface.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
