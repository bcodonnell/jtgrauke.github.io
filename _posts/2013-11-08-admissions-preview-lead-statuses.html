<p>The upcoming Admissions release changes a number of things. One big change: the Prospect role will be replaced by the "Lead" designation (which isÂ <em>not</em> a user role!). Leads will have different statuses that let you track where exactly they are in the application process. This video gives you a run-down of those statuses and how they'll work for you.</p>
