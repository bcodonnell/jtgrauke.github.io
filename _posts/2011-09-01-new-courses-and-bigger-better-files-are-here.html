<p>As September eclipsed August, the Populi crew stayed up into the wee hours pushing our new course and files features out into the wild. We've <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/big-files-better-assignments-new-question-types/">previewed</a> our new features in a few <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/a-video-preview-of-our-upcoming-improvements-to-courses/">recent</a> blog posts; here's a more complete description of what's new in Populi this morning...</p>
<h5>Courses</h5>
<p>We moved course instances over to our new tabbed layout, improving the look and organization of Populi courses.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/08/Nav.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2173" title="Nav" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/08/Nav.png" alt="" width="510" height="22" /></a></p>
<p>Tabs include Dashboard, Info, Assignments, Lessons, Discussions, Tests, Calendar, Roster, Gradebook, Attendance, and Reporting.</p>
<p>The new Course Dashboard features Course Alerts, a revamped Bulletin Board, a Schedule of upcoming course events, and updates to your Discussions.</p>
<p>Assignments now come in three flavors: Grade-only (just a grade, nuthin' more), Test (creates an online test), and File (lets teacher and student interact and revise a file, document, etc.).</p>
<p>Lessons now let you incorporate streaming media right from the lesson content thanks to our new files setup.</p>
<p>Discussions can now be course-wide or pinned to particular Lessons.</p>
<p>Tests feature two new question types: True/False and Matching. They're also created via "test" type assignments.</p>
<p>The course Calendar is now a tab right on the course page and feeds upcoming events into the course Dashboard.</p>
<p>Reporting features the Performance Dashboard and an enhanced Change Log.</p>
<h5>Files</h5>
<p><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/file-storage-and-streaming-media/">Free file storage</a>—including hosting, bandwidth, and streaming—included with every pricing plan, with extra storage available for $2.50 per GB per month.</p>
<p>Increased file upload sizes throughout Populi for all your users.</p>
<p>New large file uploader lets faculty and Admins upload files up to 2 GB in size.</p>
<p>Video files automatically encoded into multiple formats optimized for playback on multiple kinds of devices.</p>
<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
<p>We updated the Populi API to allow Single Sign-on from your own custom web services.</p>
<p>Via the API, you can also pass information into Populi via your own customized inquiry form.</p>
<p>ISIR importer now orders imported ISIRS based on Processed Date.</p>
<p>Plus the usual plethora of minor visual tweaks, bugfixes, and performance optimizations.</p>
