<p><em><strong>Update: </strong></em><em>This article was published back in 2016 and some of the pricing details may be out of date by the time you read it. For complete pricing details for Stripe, <a href="https://stripe.com/us/pricing">we refer you to their own pricing page</a>!</em></p>
<p>Populi recently participated in a beta version of <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe.com</a>’s ACH product which allows many of our colleges* to easily accept tuition payments and donations at a much lower rate (0.5% + 25¢) than credit cards (2.9% + 30¢).</p>
<p>Stripe recently brought their ACH features out of beta and published new pricing. So, as of August 1st, 2016, we’re pleased to announce a major rate decrease for larger transactions! The new rate is 0.8%, with a 25¢ minimum transaction fee and a <em>$5 maximum transaction fee</em>.</p>
<p>For small transactions this new rate may be slightly higher, but for larger transactions it’s a huge cost savings. For example, for a $5,000 tuition payment:</p>
<p>Old rate:<br />
$5,000 * 0.5% + 25¢ = <strong>$25.25</strong></p>
<p>New rate:<br />
$5,000 * 0.8%, with a 25¢ minimum and $5 maximum = <strong>$5</strong></p>
<p>Either rate represents a substantial savings compared to credit cards (accepting a $5,000 credit card payment via Stripe would cost your school $145.25), but in this example your college would now pay one fifth of the old ACH rate!</p>
<p>We’re confident this price change will allow more of our clients to benefit from the convenience of accepting online payments and donations, without the substantial fees associated with credit card transactions.</p>
<p>*Because of regulations regarding the ACH network we’re not able to offer this service to all colleges; typically only to established, accredited colleges. Please contact support to see if your college qualifies.</p>
