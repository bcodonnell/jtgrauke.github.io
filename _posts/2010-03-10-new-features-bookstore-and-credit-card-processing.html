<p>We're pleased to announce the release of a whole new section of Populi: the <a href="http://bit.ly/9OOvFK"><strong>Bookstore</strong></a>. And hand-in-hand with Bookstore: <strong>Credit Card Processing</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Bookstore</strong> gives you all the tools to run your college bookstore, <strong>online and at the counter</strong>. Anyone can shop at your online storefront; <strong><br />
</strong>students can also link to it from their course reading lists. Promote your <strong>featured items</strong> and generate <strong>Buy Now</strong> links that you can integrate with your other websites. On the back-end side of things, you can customizeÂ  your categories, manage inventory, process orders, and check sales reports. The <strong>incredibly simple Point of Sale</strong> interface can run off a USB barcode scanner and credit card reader. All your sales get plugged right in to Populi <a href="http://bit.ly/abnZsF"><strong>Financial</strong></a>, with the ability to split out sales, shipping, and tax among your different accounts. And students can charge their Bookstore purchases to their regular Populi Financial accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Before you can use your Bookstore,</strong> you'll need to take care of the settings (we walk you through those in the <strong>help desk</strong>). To get started on that, go to <strong>https://<em>yourcollegename</em>.<br />
populiweb.com/bookstore</strong> and click on <strong>Admin</strong>. Once it's all set up, all of your users will be able to navigate to it directly just by clicking the Bookstore link.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> you can get a feel for the working product with the <a href="https://demo.populiweb.com/bookstore/"><strong>Demo Bookstore</strong></a>. This shows you what the customer sees; if you have a login to the Demo site, you can poke around the Admin features and Point of Sale.</p>
<p>Of course, Bookstore wouldn't go very far without <strong>credit card processing</strong>. Populi directly integrates with <strong><a href="http://www.chasepaymentech.com/">Chase Paymentech</a> merchant accounts</strong>, so your students can pay tuition and fees online and your Bookstore customers can pay by plastic. The revenue gets directly plugged in to your chart of accounts. Set up a merchant account, give us the info, and you're good to go. <strong>We've got a pretty great deal set up</strong> with Chase Paymentech: it skirts the setup fees and other junk you hate (<a href="http://www.populiweb.com/pricing"><strong>we sure hate that kind of stuff</strong></a>) and qualifies your college for much better pricing than you could get on your own. Contact <strong><a href="http://www.populiweb.com/contact">Brendan O'Donnell</a></strong> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>If you already have a merchant account with another provider,</strong> we also integrate with <a href="http://www.authorize.net/"><strong>Authorize.net</strong></a> <strong>payment gateway accounts</strong>. Authorize.net can link up with just about any merchant account out there, and it can bridge between your merchant account and Populi.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally,</strong> we've released the usual round of minor tweaks, interface polish, security enhancements, bugfixes, and so on. Our users can read all about it in the <strong>Release Notes</strong> in the <strong>help desk</strong>.</p>
