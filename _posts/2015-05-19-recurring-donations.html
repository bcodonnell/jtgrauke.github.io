<p>New in Populi: recurring donations and payments!</p>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" style="width: 505px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/Recurring%20donation.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It works with both credit cards and echecks processed through <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2015/04/stripe-integration-convenience-fees-and-more-in-our-online-payments-release/">Stripe</a>. To get started, just set up a Stripe payment gateway in Financial &gt; Settings and check off the steps listed in <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/entries/93948288">this article</a>.</p>
<p>After enabling recurring donations and payments, donors and payers will be able to select whether to make a <em>one-time</em> or <em>recurring monthly</em> payment. To help you keep track of recurring payments, the new <em>Recurring</em> reports in Billing and Donations show you all the details, including amounts, timeframes, and payment methods. You can also manage a person's recurring payments on their Profile &gt; Financial page.</p>
<h5>Stripe makes it possible</h5>
<p>We're really excited about what Stripe integration lets us offer our customers: easy signup, recurring payments, and <a href="https://stripe.com/us/pricing">better, more straightforward pricing</a> than the other processors—2.9% + 30 cents for credit cards, 0.5% + 25 cents for eChecks. To get the most out of online payments in Populi, go to Financial &gt; Settings &gt; Payment Gateways and set up a Stripe account. It's easy to sign up and easy to try it out!</p>
