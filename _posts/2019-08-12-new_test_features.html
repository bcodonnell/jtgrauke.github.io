<p>We just released a bunch of new features for online tests. Here's a look...</p>





<h5>Points calculation</h5><br />

<p>The new <em>Points Calculation</em> feature gives you three options to determine how the test's points will be distributed among its questions:</p>

	<ul>
				
		<li><em>Fixed points:</em> You manually distribute the points while you design or edit the test.</li>

		<li><em>Weight questions equally:</em> As you add questions, the test's points will be evenly distributed among all the questions, automatically.</li>

		<li><em>Question points total:</em> The test (and assignment) points will add up whatever points you assign to individual test questions.</li>

	</ul>




<h5>Edit all question points at once</h5>

<p>If you want to change how many points each question is worth, the new <em>Edit all Question Points</em> function lets you do that for the whole test all at once&mdash;no more need to edit each individual question (though you can still do that, too).</p>

<h5>Importing tests and questions</h5>

<p>The course Test &gt; Questions view now lets you import questions from other courses to which you have faculty or admin access. We also spruced up the <em>Import Test</em> feature&mdash;now called <em>Import Test Sections</em>, it lets you import individual questions, headings and text, or even the entire test.</p>

<h5>Duplicating questions</h5>


<p>When editing an existing question, you can now choose to edit the original question (and change it everywhere) or duplicate the question and edit only the copy.</p>
