	2019 has been a big year for us with a lot of focus on making sure Populi can continue to serve you well for years to come. In addition to 
	the <a href="/blog/2019/12/new-search/">all new Search engine</a> we released recently, the biggest development project of the year
	was one you probably didn&#8217;t notice at all. In 2019, a tremendous amount of effort and attention has gone into the biggest infrastructural 
	upgrade Populi has ever been through; one that is designed to keep Populi humming <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=6J_2tKCwu7Q">merrily</a> along as more and more of you use it 
	more and more every day. 
</p>

<p>
	Another big push this year was in improving how we communicate with all of you. Key pieces have been ongoing live training webinars, and our new <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/channel/UCdLnn8DNpwKKbD5WCL8dq4A">YouTube channel (go smash subscribe!)</a>. We&#8217;re making sure to keep our social channels up to date so you can keep up with what&#8217;s going on with Populi. To that end, please do follow us on whatever channels you like to use. In addition to YouTube, you can find us on <a href="https://twitter.com/Populi">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/populico/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/populico/">Instagram</a>, and even <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/populi">LinkedIn</a>.

<p>
	As always, from everyone here to all of you whoÂ made 2019 a great year to work at Populi, we wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Here on the cusp of the <em>next</em> decade, it bears mentioning that a handful of you have been with us since before the start of <em>this</em> one (and a fair few more for very nearly that long). Thank you for taking a chance on us. We hope that we&#8217;ve served you well over the past years, and that we&#8217;ll continue to do so for many more. It&#8217;s not hyperbole to say that we wouldn&#8217;t be here today if it weren&#8217;t for y&#8217;all. So, thank you, thank you, thank you.
