<p>New in Populi Financial: Donations.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/123909897" width="615" height="346" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Donations lets you keep track of fundraising campaigns, accept online donations, record other contributions (checks received in the mail, etc.), and, of course, generate reports on any of this activity. Paired with Populi's communications and contacts features, Donations helps you manage your school's relationships with its donors—while giving you brand-new ways to help get money in the door. Here's a look at what you can do...</p>
<h5>Online donations</h5>

<p>If you're set up with credit card processing, you can start accepting online donations. Online donation pages give you options for what amounts your supporters can donate, which funds they can donate to, and whether donations received through that page should be connected to particular campaigns and appeals. You can embed your pages on your website or email newsletter and customize their appearance with your own custom CSS. Online donation pages are a great way to make donating to your school easier than ever.</p>
<h5>Campaigns and appeals</h5>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/Campaign.png" alt="" width="615" height="350" /></p>
<p>Campaigns and appeals help you track your progress towards your fundraising goals. Appeals are fundraising communications or events used to solicit donations—anything from a "Remember to Give" postcard to a fundraising golf tournament. You can link donations to campaigns and individual appeals; Populi can also calculate the return on investment by comparing costs with results. Campaigns help you gain insight into what approaches work—or don't—when it comes to fundraising.</p>
<h5>Donor profiles</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/Donor%20Organization.png" alt="" width="615" height="228" /></p>
<p>The new Donations tab, available on organization profiles and the Profile &gt; Financial tab, collects all the information you have about a donor's activity. You can record new donations, link to past donations, and print yearly summaries.</p>
<h5>Reports</h5>

<p>Reporting includes the new donations Dashboard, which summarizes donor activity, and the Donations and Donors reports, each of which feature the upgraded report filter. The new filter includes some built-in report filters that let you quickly find commonly-desired information—<em>Donors who donated last year but not this</em>, for example. It also lets you save your filters as custom reports that you can share with other staff or keep for your own use. Report actions let you do a number of tasks—including printing receipts and summaries, tagging your donors, and exporting your report to XLS.</p>
<h5>Communications and contacts</h5>
<p>Of course, Donations works in concert with Populi's existing communication and contact features. Want to email everyone who donated to the Library? Want to put all of your alumni donors on a Communication Plan? Want to tag businesses that have donated in the past three years? Want to print envelopes and mail out summaries before tax season? No problem.</p>
