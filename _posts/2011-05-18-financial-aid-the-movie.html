<h5>Covering Aid by Year, Batch Disbursement, ISIRs Imports, Aid Classifications, and Aid Year Schedules</h5>
<p>We recently posted a <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/05/coming-soon-a-refresh-for-populi-financial-aid/">brief rundown</a> of the exciting new financial aid features we will soon release. And now, here's a couple of videos demonstrating how we are improving the process of adding and disbursing aid on student accounts. To summarize, currently we treat Financial Aid as a payment method managed strictly on a by-term basis. But soon Populi will let you handle Aid more accurately: you'll be able to manage awards on the by-year basis and manage disbursements on the by-term level. This will permit all kinds of really handy automations and ought to really speed up your financial workflows.</p>
