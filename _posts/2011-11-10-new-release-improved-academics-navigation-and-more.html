<p>The Populi development team just released the latest in a series of low-key updates to the system. Like other recent updates, this one improves Populi's back-end performance and gives some spit-and-polish to the appearance and interface. Here are the big things we let out of the gate last night...</p>
<h5>Improved navigation in Academics</h5>
<p>You've <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/11/some-upcoming-changes-to-academics-and-custom-info/">seen the video</a>; now you can log in and dig the new and improved navigation in Academics.</p>

<h5>Custom info management</h5>
<p>We broke out Custom Info management among Admin, Academics, and Admissions. This clarifies the connection between custom info fields and where you'll use them in Populi.</p>
<h5>A bunch of other things</h5>
<p>You can now change a student's Programs to <em>inactive</em>. This is really useful when a student changes Programs mid-stream or when a student graduates and moves into a new Program at your school.</p>
<p>You can now include custom information on your custom transcripts.</p>
<p>The online application form now lets your prospects choose specific programs in addition to degrees and specializations.</p>
<p>Also in Admissions, we opened up application information to the APIâ€”now you can pull an applicant's data to your own custom web app.</p>
<p>For our Canadian customers, Financial Aid now features a built-in, automatic T4A report which lets you export a spreadsheet, PDF copies for your students, or an XML file for the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
<p>We also included the usual round of bugfixes, server updates, and other little items to help keep Populi running right.</p>
