<p>The Populi development team is plugging away at our next release. Here's a glance at some of it:</p>
<h5>Personal settings for all users</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-01-at-1.30.07-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2257" style="margin-left: 117px; margin-right: 117px;" title="Screen shot 2012-02-01 at 1.30.07 PM" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-01-at-1.30.07-PM.png" alt="" width="275" height="22" /></a></p>
<p>Depending on your user roles, you'll have different options—Timezone, birthday announcement opt-out, Activity Feed visibility, plus a few other things.</p>
<h5>Organization profiles</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-1-12OrgMembers.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2258" title="2-1-12OrgMembers" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-1-12OrgMembers.png" alt="" width="510" height="271" /></a><br />
Organization Profiles are getting the look and functionality of regular Profiles. In addition to an Activity Feed, there'll also be a Members tab that lets you keep track of people in your system who are associated with that organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-15-12-Add-Org.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2270" style="margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;" title="2-15-12 Add Org" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-15-12-Add-Org.png" alt="" width="454" height="260" /></a><br />
Associating people with Organizations will be easier—add new Orgs right from a person's Info tab. You can also specify the relationship (Employment, Member, and for <em>College</em> type orgs, Student) and the timeframe of the person's involvement with the Org.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also: custom info fields for Organizations!</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">New reports and workflows in Library</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-15-12-Circulation-reporting.png"><img class=" wp-image-2271 alignleft" title="2-15-12 Circulation reporting" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-15-12-Circulation-reporting.png" alt="" width="510" height="163" /></a></p>
<p>We'll be releasing a Circulation report with multiple perspectives on your active loans. In addition, there will be Inventory and Resource Batching tools in the Library Catalog.</p>
<h5>Email dropboxing</h5>
<p>The other marquee feature is email dropboxing. Dropboxing works by giving you a secret email address. When you copy or forward to that secret address, Populi will figure out the recipients and post your email to their Activity Feeds. The best part is, you can do this from <em>any</em> email client—Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, iOS Mail app, etc.—not just Populi. This will make your communications easier than ever to record, and will make the Activity Feed a more complete record of your correspondence with prospects, students, and other contacts.</p>
