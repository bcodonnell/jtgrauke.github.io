<h5>But not as advanced as Age of Empires</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net">Information is Beautiful</a>, a data visualization site run by one David McCandless, has <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/million-lines-of-code/">charted the relative sizes of the codebases</a> of some notable games, machines, and computer programs. Visualized in terms of number of lines of code, it's an interesting look at just how much programming's required to make things run.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Populi, at around a half-million lines of code, beats out the Space Shuttle by a cool 100,000 lines. TAKE THAT, NASA.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Granted, that's a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison—the Shuttle software was designed in the late-70's and early-80's for the high-end computers of the time. A more apples-to-apples comparison would measure Populi alongside another modern, complex, person-centric app driven by a relational database. The only other thing like that on here is... Facebook, weighing in at around 61 million lines of code (and one-point-something <em>billion</em> users).</p>
