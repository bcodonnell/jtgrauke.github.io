<p>We've <strong><a href="http://www.populiweb.com/blog/2009/07/apps-we-use/">mentioned some of the software</a></strong> we use around here. Well, some of the software we use <strong><a href="http://productblog.37signals.com/products/2010/03/populi-campfire-has-all-but-replaced-the-replyall-email-noise-that-used-to-plague-the-office.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">has now mentioned us</a></strong>. 37signals asked their customers for stories describing how their products have improved the way work gets done. We responded to the call, and they put our story up on their<strong> <a href="http://productblog.37signals.com/"><strong>Product Blog</strong></a></strong> today.</p>
