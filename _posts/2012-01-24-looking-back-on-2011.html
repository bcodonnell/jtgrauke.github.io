<p>Three weeks and change into 2012, here's a look back at what Populi did in 2011...</p>
<p><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/01/january-4-2010-update/">We started the New Year</a> with a rewrite of Academics to include Programs, as well as new account management features and better navigation in Admissions.</p>
<p>In April we released <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/04/populi-library-2/">Populi Library</a>.</p>
<p>In June we overhauled <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/06/our-new-financial-aid-features/">Financial Aid</a> to include aid applications, batch disbursements, ISIRs imports, and a lot more.</p>
<p>In September we overhauled <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/09/new-courses-and-bigger-better-files-are-here/">Courses</a> with new navigation, lots of improvements to online learning, and embeddable streaming media hosted on Populi's new <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/file-storage-and-streaming-media/">file storage system</a>.</p>

<p>Along the way...</p>
<p>In February we <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/02/new-release-improves-search-degree-audits-relationships-and-statements/">improved search, degree audits, relationships, and statements</a>.</p>
<p>In March we improved the presentation and organization <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/03/new-release-features-more-improvements-to-statements/">student financial info</a> (statements, balances, and the like...).</p>
<p>In April we added <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/04/a-few-new-items-for-the-online-application-process/">online application notifications</a> so your Admissions staff can hear about new inquiries as soon as they click Submit.</p>
<p>After releasing Library, we followed up with new features (<a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/04/a-few-library-things/">Library Links</a>) and <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/07/an-update-to-library-and-some-other-things/">some other updates.</a></p>
<p>October saw some behind-the-scenes <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/10/what-weve-been-working-on-lately/">stability and performance improvements</a>.</p>
<p>And in December (right before shuffling off to the Christmas party), <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/12/new-release-back-end-stuff-and-a-new-look-in-tables/">we released further improvements</a> to email and the Populi background job-manager, and gave tables a new look.</p>
<p>We have a lot planned for 2012—and we're working on some of it even as this post is being written. We're looking forward to the work we'll get to do, and to seeing how our schools put the fruits of our labors to use.</p>
