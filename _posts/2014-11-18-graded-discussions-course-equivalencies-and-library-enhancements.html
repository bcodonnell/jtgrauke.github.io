<p>Concerning software releases, we've been busy the past few weeks...</p>
<h4>Graded discussions</h4>
<p>Graded discussions let you grade your students for their participation in a discussion. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>You create a new discussion-type assignment, and either use it to start a new discussion or link it to an existing discussion.</li>
<li>You then have options to set up grading requirements, giving points for posting a minimum number of comments or replies, number of words posted, average peer rating—among many other criteria.</li>
<li>If you wish, you can set the discussion to close on a certain date and time, after which Populi can auto-grade your students based on your grading requirements.</li>
<li>The discussion assignment page presents all of your students' discussion info—including comments and participation stats—so you can easily grade the assignment by hand if you so choose.</li>
</ol>
<p>The grading features are a major part of a general overhaul of course discussions, which now include...</p>
<h5>Peer rating</h5>
<p>When you enable peer rating, students can rate one another's comments and replies from one to five stars. You can include peer rating stats as a discussion grading requirement.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-peer-rating.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2728" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-peer-rating.png" alt="11-18-14 peer rating" width="609" height="120" /></a></p>
<h5>Post first</h5>
<p>You can now require students to post to the discussion before they can see anyone else's comments.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-14-18-Post-first.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2725" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-14-18-Post-first.png" alt="11-14-18 Post first" width="609" height="79" /></a></p>
<h5>Improved comment reporting</h5>
<p>When students report inappropriate comments, you now have better tools to handle these reports—and more accountability for the student who submits the report.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-comment-report.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2729" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-comment-report.png" alt="11-18-14 comment report" width="609" height="199" /></a></p>
<h5>Draft mode</h5>
<p>If you're not ready for students to know about an upcoming discussion—maybe it's a surprise assignment, or perhaps you're still working on the grading requirements—you can leave it in <em>Draft</em> mode. When you're ready for it to get out there, just set it to <em>Published</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-draft-mode.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2730" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-draft-mode.png" alt="11-18-14 draft mode" width="609" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>To get a look at everything you can do with discussions now, have a look at the <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/entries/104549326-Graded-discussions">Populi Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
<h5>Attendance</h5>
<p>Course attendance now features ID photos (like the Roster), radio buttons for attendance status, and new action links to mark all students either Present, Absent, Tardy, or Excused.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-attendance.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2731" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-attendance.png" alt="11-18-14 attendance" width="609" height="222" /></a></p>
<h4>Course equivalencies</h4>
<p>In Academics, we added course equivalencies. Equivalencies are specified at the course catalog level. Effectively, this lets you substitute any course for any other in a student's academic history. For example, say you make ENG101 an equivalent of WRI101:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="task-title">Students who took WRI101 will show that they have completed a degree course requirement for ENG101 on the Degree Audit.</span></li>
<li><span class="task-title">Students who took ENG101 will be able to register for a course that has WRI101 as a prerequisite.</span></li>
<li><span class="task-title">Students who need to retake ENG101 can take WRI101 instead.</span></li>
<li><span class="task-title">And vice-versa for all of the above...</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can now use Course Groups as prerequisites for catalog courses. This lets you treat a group of courses as equivalent (<em>take this course</em> OR <em>this other course</em>...) when setting up prereqs.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-prereq.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2732" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/11/11-18-14-prereq.png" alt="11-18-14 prereq" width="450" height="222" /></a></p>
<h4>Library enhancements</h4>
<p>We've added a bunch of little (but significant!) things to Library the past few weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library Staff can now place holds on behalf of patrons.</li>
<li>Additionally, they can now renew loans, even if the affected resource has a hold or is overdue.</li>
<li>You can now see the due date for each resource when checking them out to a patron.</li>
<li>If you remove a copy from circulation, any holds on it will be transferred to the next available copy.</li>
<li>
<div>When placing a hold, patrons and staff can now choose which resource copy they want.</div>
<div></div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Library staff can now click <strong># of holds</strong> to see a list of all the holds for a resource, and their associated data. They can also manage which resource copy the hold is on, or cancel the hold—all from the same dialog box.</div>
</li>
<li>You can now manually pull Library resources.</li>
<li>We've limited the resource type drop-downs on Library search to show only the resource types you currently have entered in Library.</li>
<li>Library search results now display up to five resource copies, together with their locations and call numbers if possible. So, now you can find out if there's a copy and where to grab it without clicking through to the copy page.</li>
<li><span class="task-title">And finally, if you hate pressing "Enter" on your keyboard for Library (and Bookstore) searches, there's now a </span><em>Go</em><span class="task-title"> button you can click!</span></li>
</ul>
