<p>On Tuesday, January 24th, the U.S. Senate is slated to vote on the <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s968/show">Protect Intellectual Property Act</a> (PIPA). Together with its counterpart bill in the House of Representatives, the <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3261/show">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> (SOPA)*, it seeks to curtail online bootlegging from overseas websites via several means:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives the U.S. government the power to force internet service providers to block access sites that traffic in bootlegged (or, in the words of the bill's proponents, <em>pirated</em>) content.</li>
<li>The government could also sue search engines and other websites to prevent them from linking to such sites.</li>
<li>U.S. credit card companies and advertisers would be required to cancel their accounts with those sites so as to cut off their sources of funding.</li>
<li>It prescribes jail sentences for users who post copyrighted works or links to infringing sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>We here at Populi oppose these two bills for a number of reasons. Our chief concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>They extend considerable powers to the U.S. government to shut down sites that the beneficiary corporations consider "infringing".</li>
<li>They allow corporations to sue the owners of such "infringing" sites.</li>
<li>The bills are draconian: the government could block sites like Facebook and Twitter if <em>just one user</em> posted <em>just one link</em> to an infringing site.</li>
<li>The smallest infraction runs afoul of the bill's harshest measures.</li>
<li><strong>Perhaps worst of all:</strong> the bills destabilize the Domain Name System (DNS), one of the key methods used to make the internet secure and at all trustworthy.</li>
</ul>

<p>We care about the internet—it lets us serve our customers and earn a living, after all—and PIPA and SOPA are foolish, short-sighted pieces of legislation that will do great harm to it.</p>

<blockquote><p>* <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/204167-sopa-shelved-until-consensus-is-found">SOPA was shelved</a> on January 16th, which means that the House won't vote on it. It is currently very wounded, but not dead.</p></blockquote>
