<p><a href="http://www.webpop.com">Webpop</a>, a cloud-based content management system and code editor that lets you build websites, <a href="http://www.webpop.com/blog/2013/04/16/can-a-puppy-sell-a-cms">recently ran an experiment</a> on the signup link for their 30-day free trial:</p>
<blockquote><p>A while ago we launched an interesting little test to dig into the effect of emotional engagement. In this case we decided to test the click through rate on our call to action at the bottom of most of our pages where we urge people to give our 30 day free trial a shot.</p></blockquote>
<p>They put up a picture of a black lab puppy gazing at the signup button; next, they compared the click-rate between the puppy-version and the text-only version. The results were startling:</p>
<blockquote><p>It turns out, the puppy version had more than <strong>double </strong>the number of clicks on the signup button than the text only version, with a statistical certainty of more than 99.9% of this being more than just random coincidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Double the clicks! That's, frankly, amazing. Seeing that we were probably leaving money on the table, we cast aside our convictions about <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2012/11/selling/">straightforward marketing</a> and inaugurated an experiment of our own:</p>
<h5>Introducing: the Signup Piglet</h5>
<p>Not having any puppies around the office, we decided to make use of our ready access to piglets (not that we have piglets running around the office... though, a man can dream, can't he?). So, here she is—the Signup Piglet! Click anywhere on this little straw-covered cutie to go to our signup form, where you can contact us about a demo or subscribe to our newsletter.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
