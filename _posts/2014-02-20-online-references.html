<p>We just released an improved version of online references. References were introduced with the <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2014/01/new-admissions-new-look-new-reports-weve-been-busy/">new Admissions release</a> from last December, and after receiving feedback from customers, we found lots of ways to improve them.</p>
<h5>New Admissions setting</h5>
<p>You'll notice a new tab in Admissions &gt; Settings for Online Reference Forms. This is where you'll create and edit your reference forms (you can have as many as you need).</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/02/2-13-14-reference-forms-navigation.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2603" alt="2-13-14 reference forms navigation" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/02/2-13-14-reference-forms-navigation.png" width="610" height="68" /></a></p>
<h5>Default form for schools already using online references</h5>
<p>If you've already included a reference form in your application, you'll see a form called "Default". That one is presently included in your application. It collects the same information as the one you're already using: name, number, and an essay field. If that form is handling your needs, you don't need to do anything: it's already set up.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/02/2-13-14-default.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2604" alt="2-13-14 default" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/02/2-13-14-default.png" width="610" height="421" /></a></p>
<h5>Design a custom form</h5>
<p>Many schools need a more complex form than the basic essay. You can now design that custom reference form right inside Populi (or update the Default form). It works just like building an application, and you have almost as many options in the reference form as you do in the application designer.</p>

<h5>How it works</h5>
<p>Include it in an application when adding new fields.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/02/2-17-14-add-to-applic.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2606" alt="2-17-14 add to applic" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/02/2-17-14-add-to-applic.png" width="610" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>On the applicant's side, it works just as before: he just enters an email address, and when he submits, Populi sends the reference a link to your online reference form.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/02/2-17-14-barack.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2607" alt="2-17-14 barack" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/02/2-17-14-barack.png" width="610" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>Keep an eye on the Admissions Dashboard for newly-submitted reference forms, and then process them just like you would any other application field (you can also edit the answers on submitted references).</p>
