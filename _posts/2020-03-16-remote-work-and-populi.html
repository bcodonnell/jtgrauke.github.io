	The word <em>Quarantine</em> is on everyone&#8217;s minds nowadaysâ€”and everyone&#8217;s sorting out what that might mean as many routine things of life are suddenly subject to interruption. In case you were wondering about Populi and whether it would be available, we wanted to take a moment to allay your concerns.
</p>
<p>
	Populi is now, and has always been, one hundred percent set up for remote work. While we do have a headquarters where the majority of our employees have a desk, all of our essential functions are completely online. So, whether or not someone is at the office, they can perform all of their particular duties in the same way. 
</p>
<p>
	This means that even if we can&#8217;t come to the office for whatever reason (and provided we have internet access) we can still answer your support requests, do training sessions, take your calls, keep tabs on our servers, fix bugs, and share memes with each other. 
</p>
<p>
	Things can change, but as far as we can tell, Populi will remain available for everyone at your school amidst the uncertainty of the coming weeks and months.
</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions or concerns about this, or anything else, please reach out to <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/">Populi Support</a>.
