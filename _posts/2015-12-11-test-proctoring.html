<p>Test proctoring lets you require that a third party keep an eye on your online students when taking a test. It uses <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2012/03/sms/">SMS messaging</a> to give the proctor codes to "check in" and "check out" to verify that he was there the entire time the student was taking the test. Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>When setting up the test, you can specify whether or not to require proctoring. You can also require proctoring for specific students by adding a proctoring exception.</li>
<li>The student goes to take an online test in Populi as normal.</li>
<li>Before he can start the test, Populi asks for contact information from the proctor, including a mobile phone number. The proctor fills it out right there—no separate login required!—and submits it.</li>
<li>Populi sends the proctor an SMS with a check-in code. The proctor enters the code and lets the student back on the computer.</li>
<li>The student takes the test.</li>
<li>After the student submits the test, the proctor receives another SMS with a check-out code. After entering the code and checking to confirm that the student took the test without cheating, it's all done!</li>
<li>If everything is above-board, then no further action is needed. But if the proctor has concerns, she can contact the school; likewise, the course faculty will find the proctor's contact info attached to the test.</li>
</ol>
