<p>After about twenty minutes of work yesterday, we added emoji support to Populi. Emojis are little inline text characters similar to emoticons. First invented and made popular by Japanese mobile phone operators for use in text messages, they have evolved into a more-or-less standard set of characters.</p>

<p>You can use Emojis anywhere "social" in Populi, such as news comments, course discussions, and bulletin boards. They're simple to add—just type colons around an Emoji keyword (i.e. <em>:smiley:</em>) and post your comment. Your emoji will show up right in the text of what you've written.
