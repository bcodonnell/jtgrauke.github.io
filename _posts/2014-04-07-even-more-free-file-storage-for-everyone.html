<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Do you remember where you were on June 18th, 2013? The last time we went and </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://populi.co/blog/2013/06/more-free-file-storage-for-everyone/">upped everyone's free file storage limit</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">?  We remember where we were: that day, we were upping your free file storage limit. This is kind of like that, except we're not even waiting for the summer to . . .</span></p>
<p><strong>. . . give everyone even more free file storage.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://populi.co/pricing">Every plan</a> has already received <strong>more</strong> for the <strong>same</strong>—which is for <em>free</em>. It happened and you didn't even notice!</p>
<p>Are you on the so-called s<em>mall </em>plan? Where you used to get a measly 50 gigs of free storage? Now you get 100 gigs of free storage.</p>
<p>The <em>medium </em>plan? Been wishing you had more than 100 gigs of free file storage? You've been gazing wistfully at the <em>large</em> plan's 200 gigs? Now it's yours. 200 gigs of free storage.<i><br />
</i></p>
<p>The <em>large </em>plan. You had 200 gigs of free file storage. Pretty good. What would be great? 500 gigs would be great, right? And that's what you get. 500 gigs of free storage.</p>
<p>Our Plan Pricing remains the same. So all those extra gigs-per-month really are <em>free</em>.</p>
<p>Enjoy it. Use it. You'll have even more room to store and deliver your video and audio lectures and materials. Start uploading <em>dumb</em> stuff—like daily videos of your coffee cooling, accompanied by in-depth commentary—just because you can.</p>
<p>This applies to all of our current customers and anyone else who has yet to <a href="http://populi.co/signup">jump aboard with Populi</a>. That extra file storage is yours to use right now!</p>
