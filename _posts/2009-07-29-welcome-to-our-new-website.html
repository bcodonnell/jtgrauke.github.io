<h5>Not to mention our new blog, too...</h5>
<p>We trust you’ll find the redesigned <strong>www.populiweb.com</strong> to be more informative, usable, and easier on the eyes than our previous website. If you haven't already poked around the site, here's a fast overview:</p>
<p>Populi’s big-picture lives in the <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/about"><strong>About</strong></a> section. <strong>“We’re here to solve a problem,”</strong> we begin, and then we tell you, well, how Populi solves it. You’ll also find a brief corporate history.</p>
<p>You’ll find a lot of meat in the <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/tour/"><strong>Tour</strong></a> section, which describes <strong>Populi’s approach and features</strong>, in addition to screenshots.</p>
<p>Of equal interest, probably, is our <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/pricing/"><strong>Pricing</strong></a> page, in which we tell you exactly what we charge—which, incidentally, is <strong>$200 a month plus $7 per student</strong>—without having us contact you with a sales pitch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.populiweb.com/contact">Contact</a></strong> lets you know <strong>how to get a hold of us</strong>, as a company and individually, and lets you sign up for a demo and/or the newsletter.</p>
<p>And, of course, this here <strong>Blog</strong>, which you’re reading. The Populi Blog will cover, of course, Populi—software updates, more about our company and people, support, other announcements—as well as software in general, the web in particular, higher education (especially small colleges), and some things of general interest. We intend to update it once or twice a week—and maybe more frequently, as time permits.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking in with us!</p>
