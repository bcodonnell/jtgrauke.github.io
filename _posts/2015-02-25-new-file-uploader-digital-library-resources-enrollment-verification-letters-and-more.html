<p>The developers have been drinking their coffee and eating their energy bars, and as a result, Populi now does dozens of new things it didn't do a few weeks ago. Where to begin? How about with the...</p>
<h5>New file uploader</h5>
<p>The new file uploader lets you drag-and-drop files—up to two gigabytes in size—right into your browser window to upload them into Populi. It's available to all users wherever you can upload files: everywhere from ID photos, activity feeds, and course assignments to applications, page layouts, and library resources (among many other places).</p>
<p>Of course, you can still do the whole search-for-the-file-you-want-to-upload thing, but why do that when you can do this?</p>

Digital library resources</h5>
<p>You can now offer digital resources through your Library. Simply upload the files to the resource, and they'll be available for viewing and downloading to your patrons.</p>

<h5>Enrollment verification letters</h5>
<p>You can now print proof of enrollment letters for your students. For that matter, your students can print them, too! To get you started, we've included a customizable Enrollment Verification document in Communications &gt; Page Layouts. Contact Populi Support if you'd like us to fix up your enrollment letter layout.</p>

<h5>New tuition schedule options in Data Slicer</h5>
<p>You can now use the Data Slicer to add, remove, or replace the tuition schedules for groups of students.</p>

<h5>PDF exports</h5>
<p>What used to export as an .odt file—transcripts, custom statements, etc.—can now be exported as a PDF.</p>
