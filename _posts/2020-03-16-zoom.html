<p>Your Populi courses can now use Zoom, the video communication platform. Zoom lets you conduct live online meetings, webinars, chats, and more.</p>

<p>To use the new integration, your school will need a Zoom account&mdash;if you don't have one yet, have a look at their <a href="https://zoom.us/education">education page</a> or sign up for a <a href="https://zoom.us/pricing">paid account here</a> (your school will need, at minimum, the Pro Plan&mdash;but you'll likely want to look at one of the education plans). After entering your Zoom credentials in Populi, your faculty will be able to use Zoom via the Course &gt; Conferences view.</p>

<p>With a lot of colleges suddenly needing to consider online learning options, we hope the new integration makes things at least a little easier for our customers to continue serving their students.</p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002285254">Populi Knowledge Base</a> for instructions on how to set up and use the new Zoom integration (as well as our existing BigBlueButton integration).</p>
