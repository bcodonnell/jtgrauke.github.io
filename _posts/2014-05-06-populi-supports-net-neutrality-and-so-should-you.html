<p>From Free Press' <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality">Save The Internet</a> site:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Jan. 14, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., struck down the Federal Communications Commission’s Open Internet Order.</p>
<p>And now, the FCC is proposing rules that would kill — rather than protect — Net Neutrality and allow rampant discrimination online.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is net neutrality anyway? And why should you care? One of my favorite YouTubers, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey">CGP Grey</a>, does a great job explaining not just what net neutrality is, but why we must defend it.</p>

<p>So what difference can we make? The White House has already responded to <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/restore-net-neutrality-directing-fcc-classify-internet-providers-common-carriers/5CWS1M4P">this petition</a> asking for a restoration of net neutrality, and while this is a good start it doesn't actually get us any closer to the goal of preserving a free and open internet.</p>
<p>Save The Internet has a <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do">number of ideas</a> about how <em>we the people</em> can keep the pressure on the FCC to do the right thing. On behalf of Populi, I encourage you to check out the list and take action to defend net neutrality.</p>
