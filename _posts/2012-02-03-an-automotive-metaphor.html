<p>Say your small college is a family of five, you're shopping for a car, and you're wondering what's out there. Here's are some of your options:</p>
<h5>On the low-cost end you find:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The Word and Excel approach. This is like tying two bicycles together and calling it a car. It's cheap, it rolls, and you're gonna lose your groceries if you try pedaling home on that thing.</li>
<li>The roll-your-own Access-based system. This is a bicycle tied to a wheelbarrow, or perhaps a Flintstones-style, foot-powered car: either way, there's lots of hard work involved to make it go anywhere.</li>
<li>The K-12 program wedged into a higher education context. This is a riding lawn mower used as family transportation.</li>
<li>The fly-by-night company that barfs out something software-ish. This is the shifty used-car salesman pushing a beater '85 Plymouth with no muffler and the stuffing pulled out of the back seats. Also, it's on fire.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Then there are the big guys:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The giant hosted database with no interface. This is a 48' shipping container. I guess your family could just watch it sit there.</li>
<li>The LMS with all the bells and whistles. This is the luxury tour bus with the helipad and built-in swimming pool that gets two miles a gallon on the highway because it's too expensive to give it an oil change.</li>
<li>The open-source LMS. This is a school bus built out of parts from other vehicles and painted up to look like the luxury tour bus. Slightly better gas mileage on downhill slopes, though.</li>
<li>The huge, endlessly-customizable SIS with a three-year implementation period. This looks like you've ordered a custom-built Ferrari but by the time all the parts get bolted together you've ended up with a surplus U.S. Army transport.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, you'll need a team of mechanics to make sure your fleet of vehicles fits together. You'll also need a warehouse full of spare parts and some long-term maintenance contracts. Oh, and for some reason the window glass on the bus is all blacked-outâ€”so you'll need to hire a third-party automotive glazier to design you a clear windshield.</p>
<h5>Is that it?</h5>
<p>Is that all that's available to a small college? Of course not. This is the Populi blog, and so now we're gonna liken Populi to the perfect family car... ready? Here goes:</p>
<p>Then there's Populi. This is the Toyota minivan, which seats five to seven, has a <a href="http://populi.co/about/support">lifetime parts-and-labor warranty</a>, and even has a built-in <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/file-storage-and-streaming-media/">DVD player</a> (if that's your thing) and <a href="http://populi.co/tour/bookstore">magazine</a> <a href="http://populi.co/tour/library">rack</a>. Sure, it's nothing flashy, but it's good, dependable transportation just right for a <a href="http://populi.co/pricing/">wide variety of families</a>.    </p>
