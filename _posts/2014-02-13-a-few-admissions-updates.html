<p>We've been improving the new Admissions features we released just before Christmas. Here's a quick look at what we've done:</p>
<h5>Insert new elements</h5>
<p>We updated the application designer. Previously, you had to add new elements at the end of the application and then drag them where you needed them. Now you just click the <strong>+</strong> and add another heading, text block, or field and insert the new element wherever you need it.</p>

<p>Also, now you can see what's <em>Required</em> without having to look in the Preview tab.</p>

<h5>Application fees</h5>
<p>Previously, you had one option with application fees: collect them when the Lead started the application. Now you have the option to collect the fee at the start, or to let the Lead wait until he submits the application to pay the fee.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/01/1-29-14-Application-Fee-Choice.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2588" style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;" alt="1-29-14 Application Fee Choice" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2014/01/1-29-14-Application-Fee-Choice.png" width="436" height="154" /></a></p>
<h5>Importing field info to the profile</h5>
<p>The new application fields make it simple to collect information from the applicant that you can import directly to the Profile. We've improved that entire process:</p>
<ul>
<li>We re-worked the interface: first you select whether to link to an existing field; then you pick the field you want on the application. This lets you collect the exact information you need from the applicant to import to the Profile.</li>
<li>To import a field—say, a mailing address—just set it to <em>accepted.</em></li>
<li>When you accept the application, you can import course of study information (program, degree, specialization).</li>
<li>Now you can collect gender information using an application field.</li>
</ul>
