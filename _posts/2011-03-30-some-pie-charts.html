<p>It's picture time on the Populi blog!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First, here's a pie chart showing what Operating System people use when they get on Populi. It's no surprise that Windows XP, 7, and Vista take up 74% of the pie. It <em>is</em> interesting that Windows XP, released in 2001 (and no longer for sale by mid-2008) completely wallops Windows Vista. The last two versions of Apple's Mac OS X make up 20% of the OS pie. Mobile-wise, iOS leads Android 3 to 1. And Linux—although it's really for specialists—makes up 1% of Populi usage.*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/OS-Share.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2056" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 66px; margin-right: 66px;" title="OS Share" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/OS-Share.png" alt="" width="377" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>This next chart shows what browsers people use to access Populi. At just under 30% total, IE's 7 and 8 don't show nearly as well as they do on <a href="http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php">some</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/browser-share-gain-chrome/">other</a> browser-share charts. IE8 is looking over its shoulder at Google Chrome's 19% share. Safari's 13% (16% if you want to include Safari Mobile) is a handsome number when compared with its ~6% share of the internet at large. Firefox enjoys a commanding lead over every other browser. That grey 4% wedge includes all the outdated or beta-only outliers—IE's 6 and 9, Android, Chrome 0-8, Chrome 11, Safari 3-4, Camino, Firefox 2-3—as well as random stuff like BlackBerry. Mercifully, the hard number on IE6 is only 0.01%.*</p>

<p>And this is a folding trapdoor spider we found on the bike trail that goes past our office. Yeah, it was big.</p>
