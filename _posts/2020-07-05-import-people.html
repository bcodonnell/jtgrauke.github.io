<p>We just released a new bulk <em>Import People</em> feature in Contacts. It lets you add groups of new people to Populi all at one time by uploading XLSX or CSV files. The importer will be a great help to admissions staff who need to enter large groups of leads from conferences, referral service purchases, and standardized tests. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>

<p>In Contacts &gt; People, you&#8217;ll see a big fat <em>Import People</em> button right next to <em>Add New Person</em>. Click that and upload your file to Populi; from thence you&#8217;ll be whisked to the column-mapping screen.</p>

<p>Mapping columns lets you choose where the information from your file will plug into Populi&#8217;s built-in and custom fields. Populi will automatically match the obvious stuff like &#8220;First Name&#8221;; you&#8217;ll decide how to map the other columns using the drop-downs, which contain options for Person-related (contact info, other info, custom fields) and Admissions-related fields (course of study, etc.). For example, you may have a spreadsheet of leads with a column for &#8220;Career Interest&#8221;, the options for which correspond to your own custom Admissions field &#8220;Area of Interest&#8221;. Link them using the drop-down, and Populi will pull that column&#8217;s data into that field for all the imported people. If you later upload a file with the same column headings, Populi will remember how you mapped things last time, making future imports preposterously simple.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;re done mapping, you&#8217;ll have a chance to review the records. Populi will find potential problems and warn you about them&mdash;possible duplicates, information that can&#8217;t be imported&mdash;as well as reject records that can&#8217;t be imported (people with no first or last name, or bad data in those fields).</p>

<p>Once imported, you can easily find the group of new people by using the <em>Import</em> condition in Contacts and Admissions &gt; Leads,</p>

<p>We&#8217;re pleased to get this out to our users&mdash;it&#8217;s gonna save a lot of people a lot of time. Have a look at <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049653314">the Populi help article</a> for all the details on how it works.</p>
