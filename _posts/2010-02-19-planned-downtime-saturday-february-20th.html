<p>We're gonna be taking Populi down for about 30 minutes late Saturday night at 10 PM Pacific to update our SSL (security) certificates. If you try logging in around that time, you won't get very far (your browser will say something about an invalid security certificate). If you have any trouble immediately after the downtime, try closing your browser and restarting it.</p>
