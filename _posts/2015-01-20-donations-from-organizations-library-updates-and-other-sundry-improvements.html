<p>Some recent improvements...</p>
<h5>Organizations can make donations</h5>
<p>Yup, you can now record donations made by organizations. Just go to the org's profile, click the Donations tab, and then Record a Donation. The screen includes records of all previous donations, a breakdown by fund, and the ability to print a tax receipt.</p>
<p>You can also now export PDF receipts in bulk from the Donations report—for both individuals and organizations.</p>
<h5>Multitude of Library improvements</h5>
<p>We've improved the way Populi handles Library holds, making it easier for your Library staff to manage your resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Populi now sets the hold expiration date when you pull the copy, rather than when the copy was simply <em>assigned</em> to the hold. Previously, when setting the hold expiration date based on the assignment, this frequently resulted in holds expiring before the copy was even pulled.</li>
<li>The Holds report now shows you which holds do not yet have a copy assigned to them.</li>
<li>You can also now print a hold receipt to attach to the resource copy you've pulled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we've added three new fields to resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquisition Source (an Agent)</li>
<li>Acquisition Date</li>
<li>Replacement Price</li>
</ul>
<h5>Some other items</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2015/01/1-20-15-DA-equiv.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2752" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2015/01/1-20-15-DA-equiv.png" alt="1-20-15 DA equiv" width="613" height="251" /></a></p>
<p>We improved the display of equivalent courses in the Degree Audit, clarifying how a course requirement has been fulfilled by the student's completion of an equivalent course.</p>
<p>Course equivalencies now impact both course <em>and</em> course group prerequisites. Say ENG101 and WRI101 are equivalents and ENG101 is included in the "Core" course group:</p>
<ul>
<li>A student who passes WRI101 would qualify for courses that require ENG101 as a prereq</li>
<li>A student who takes WRI101 would qualify for courses that require the Core course group</li>
</ul>
<p>On the API front, you can now upload files via the API, including to term-based custom student fields.</p>
<p>The Financial Aid API has several new calls:</p>
<ul>
<li>getAidApplication</li>
<li>getAidApplicationForStudentAidYear</li>
<li>addAidApplication</li>
<li>editAidApplication</li>
</ul>
<p>You can now set up Bookstore tax by ZIP code to accommodate schools in states that allow differing tax rates at the county level for online sales.</p>
