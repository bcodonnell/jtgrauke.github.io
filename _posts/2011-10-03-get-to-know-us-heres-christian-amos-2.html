<p>Isaac's kids are <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/10/get-to-know-us-heres-isaac-grauke/">playing in the background</a>. Nick is just <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/10/get-to-know-us-heres-nick-holloway/">plain loud</a>. Joseph's laugh <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/01/get-to-know-us-heres-joseph-schoolland/">fills the room</a>. Patrick's got <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/get-to-know-us-heres-patrick-swanson/">fishing stories</a>. Mark plays music and <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/05/get-to-know-us-heres-mark-ackerman/">wants to build a battlebot</a>. Toby has <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/11/get-to-know-us-heres-toby-robinson/">a dragon</a>. Taken as a whole, the <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/12/merry-christmas-from-populi/">Populi guys</a> can be a pretty garrulous lot.</p>
<p>But Christian Amos? He's quiet. Real quiet. Serial-killer quiet.<br />
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/09/xtian.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2184" title="xtian" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/09/xtian.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="287" /></a><br />
Nawwww, he's not <em>that</em> quiet. But when the rest of us get to hootin' and hollerin' about, say, some dumb <a title="Y'know, like this one." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ2iNOmPI-0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">YouTube video</a>, Christian invariably remains at his desk in his headphone sanctuary, his long fingers tapping on his brushed aluminum keyboard, calling into existence features that were not just moments before. We like to joke that he's more productive than the rest of us put together, but that isn't really a joke. 'Cos he is.</p>
<p>Newly 20, Christian is the backbone of Populi's development team. When Populi releases a new feature, there's an excellent chance that Christian's able hands coded it into being. Generally speaking, James Hill (the Chief Technical Officer) conceives of the new feature, figures out its architecture, envisions how it integrates with the rest of the system... and then hands it off to Christian to fill in the details. Christian also refactors outdated features, which is a fancy developer way to say, "he rewrites them."</p>
<p>Whether working on the new or the old, "Christian codes like the wind," says Adam Sentz. "And he doesn't complain when I make him redo something for the fifth time because I've changed my mind about something or had a better idea."</p>
<p>The youngest member of the Populi crew was once the youngest developer at EMSI, joining up as an intern at age 14 to work on that company's economic modeling software. When Populi shuffled over to its own digs and corporate structure, Christian followed his mentor, James Hill, to the new company. For such a young man, he has developed the guts of some really complex, high-end software: financial aid, accounting, academics—to name a few things.</p>
<p>Mixed in with his years of real-world coding, Christian has fit in various parts of a B.S. in Computer Science, though he now has other ideas about what he wants out of his schooling. "I'd rather pursue something I don't plan to use for a career. Something that I can use for the rest of my life that'd be more enjoyable than years of complex math and computer languages. I'm thinking engineering, graphic design, or something <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/09/xtian-BW.jpg">artsy</a> like photography."</p>
<p>When he's not indoors in front of a computer, he's outdoors in any number of settings. Accompanied by his mini-breed golden retriever, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/09/Harvey.jpg">Harvey</a>, he punctuates his life with long weekends snowboarding, summer afternoons canoeing and hiking, and as much camping as he can get away with. "Getting away from the city and into, you know, a more hunter/gatherer setting is such a nice change of pace for me. I want to explore the whole world and camping allows me to explore the more rural side, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/09/xtian-harv.jpg">away from</a> all other distractions."</p>
<p>Of his future, he's characteristically taciturn: "I love the beach. Gonna live there someday. If not that, then a boat on a lake somewhere."</p>
