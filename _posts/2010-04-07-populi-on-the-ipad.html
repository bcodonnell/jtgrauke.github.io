<p>Unless you've been living on a boat in the middle of the Pacific with a broken radio, you're most likely aware of <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">Apple's new iPad</a></strong>, which—as of last Saturday (April 3)—is now available to the public. One first-day-adopter, a new customer of ours, told us this morning that "<strong>Populi (like everything else) is GORGEOUS on the iPad.</strong>"</p>
<p>Since we're not in this business to plug Apple products <strong><!--more--></strong>(though it's worth noting that most everyone here uses—and loves—Macs), here's the Populi plug: <strong>Populi looks good on the iPad</strong> because it's built according to <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/"><strong>web standards</strong></a>. Web standards are standardized technologies that make browsers and websites <strong>work better, look better, and stay more secure</strong> (among other things). As the web becomes a bigger part of our day-to-day lives, <strong>standards-compliance becomes more necessary</strong>—especially for critical software that handles information-intensive things like college management. We saw this early on, and from the get-go, <strong>Populi was built to be <a title="See &quot;Design Standards&quot;" href="http://www.populiweb.com//about/security">standards-compliant</a></strong>.</p>
<p>As a result, <strong>Populi runs beautifully on standards-compliant browsers</strong>* like <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome"><strong>Chrome</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html"><strong>Firefox</strong></a>... and, of course, Apple's own <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a></strong>—the built-in browser on the iPad. So our customer's report makes perfect sense. We're actually pretty excited about the <strong>iPad's potential in the classroom,</strong> and since Populi won't require any jerry-rigging to work on it (it doesn't even require an app), the device could give students and faculty access to everything they need from the program.** We'll see what happens.</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">*It'll run on Internet Explorer, too... but since IE is <em>not</em> standards-compliant (less secure, more buggy, and slower) we don't recommend it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">**<strong>Populi will also work on the iPhone and iPod Touch.</strong> They have Safari built-in as well (though the viewing experience is tiny), and there's also the <a href="http://www.populiweb.com//tour/more"><strong>Populi iPhone app</strong></a> (get it <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/populi/id307818267?mt=8"><strong>here</strong></a>).</span></p>
