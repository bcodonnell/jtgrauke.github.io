<p>Electronic checks let you accept online payments straight from the payer's checking account. To pay, just enter a routing number, an amount, and some other basic info—like what you'd find on a paper check—and click Pay Now. It's pretty simple for the payer. On your end, the fees are lower than credit/debit card transactions, and the turnaround time is a fraction of that of paper checks.</p>
<p>To get set up with electronic checks, you'll need to sign up for <a href="http://www.authorize.net/solutions/merchantsolutions/merchantservices/echeck/">eCheck.net</a>, an add-on product for <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.authorize.net">Authorize.net</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> payment gateway accounts. If you're already using Populi with Authorize.net for credit card processing, you're most of the way there. Just visit Authorize.net's </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.authorize.net/solutions/merchantsolutions/merchantservices/echeck/">Merchant Services</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> page and start your application. Once approved, get in touch with Populi Support and let us know you'd like to enable electronic checks.</span></p>
