<p>During the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, Adam Sentz stood in line for an E3-related event at some hip, pop-star-owned <a href="http://lalive.com/play/conga-room">nightclub</a>. Upon getting to the door, the bouncers looked at his feet and shook their heads, No.</p>
<p>"What, you mean you're not letting me in?" asked Adam.</p>
<p>"Can't let you in with sandals on," said the Los-Angeles-person-in-charge.</p>
<p>"Sandals? Sandals?" exclaimed Adam. "These are Birkenstocks! The Rolls-Royce of sandals!"</p>
<p>Adam Sentz: willing to attend a giant video game convention, style-conscious enough to expect to get in to a hot nightclub, and sufficiently Pacific Northwest to do it all in a pair of Birks.<br />
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/05/GTKU-Adam-Sentz-5-31-12.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2330" title="GTKU Adam Sentz 5-31-12" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/05/GTKU-Adam-Sentz-5-31-12.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="287" /></a></p>
<p>Adam is Populi's Chief Creative Officer. Together with James Hill (Chief Technical Officer), he leads Populi's development; his particular responsibility is Populi's interface and visual design. When Populi releases something like a <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/12/new-release-back-end-stuff-and-a-new-look-in-tables/">new look for tables</a> or <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2012/03/populi-now-has-emoji-support/">Emoji support</a>, that would be Adam earning his keep. He also designed and maintains the Populi website, takes a second look at the various fliers we print every now and then, and researches paper towels and group phone plans to help keep the Populi office functional.</p>
<p>"I'm also on the board and I think I might be VP of something," says Adam, flicking an invisible speck of dust off an immaculate pair of raw selvedge denim jeans. A timer dings on his iPhone and he turns for his office. "If you need me, I'll be <a href="http://www.matchasource.com/">whisking my Matcha</a>."</p>
<p>Adam was born and raised near Annapolis, Maryland. He found high school rather boring and left it at age 16; after taking a test to get his diploma from the state of Maryland, he went to <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu/">Full Sail University</a> in Winter Park, Florida, and earned an Associate of Science in Recording Arts. He spent a few years playing in bands, taught music theory and other courses at Full Sail for awhile, and then in short order married Cathlin (aka Cat) and moved to Moscow to take a job at EMSI working under one James Robert Hill.</p>
<p>Once in Moscow, Cat went to work for a small college in town. Part of her job forced her to use the school's student information system, an outdated old thing complemented by a dog’s breakfast of spreadsheets, documents, and other cheap software. It was so painful to use that Cat used to schedule unanesthetized root canals just to get away from the program. Adam, concerned about how much of his income was going to the dentist, jumped at the chance when James asked him one day, "Surely we could build something better than this in, like, two weeks?" The result of their work was the first version of a little thing we like to call Populi.</p>
<p>Since that time, Populi has become a viable business, one that Adam plans to work on for the foreseeable future. His lifelong friend, <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/05/get-to-know-us-heres-mark-ackerman/">Mark Ackerman</a>, says of the <em>foreseeable</em> part that Adam "has a good, almost uncanny, sense of what is going to happen in the future". That foresight—an oftentimes brashly opinionated foresight—has guided <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamalicious/4455107931/in/pool-1350381@N20/">Populi's company culture</a> in everything from customer service to release schedules to our approach to sales and marketing.</p>
<p>Populi, of course, isn't his whole life. The aforementioned Cat—community manager for <a href="http://n4g.com">N4G</a>, one of the biggest video-gaming sites going—recently gave birth to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamalicious/7122404811/in/photostream">Eleanor</a>, a little girl made mostly of cheeks and who, despite minimal control over motor functions, started <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/elliesentz">her own Twitter account</a>. Adam and Cat are <a href="http://moscowfoodies.com/">self-professed foodies</a>; she caters Populi's Friday meetings with treats like strawberry-rosemary scones and a leek-and-bacon tart that has, at last count, converted 483 atheists into sincere Christians. Nestled in their wine cabinet is a 2001 Elk Cove Pinot Noir, which was <a href="http://www.elkcove.com/reviews/review.php?p=22&amp;v=5">no mean bottle</a> even back when it was newly-corked.</p>
<p>Of course, this company bio of Adam would be remiss to not mention the technology in Adam's life. Adam <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCzN91JicA"><em>loves</em> technology</a>, particularly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cathlin/4731905541/in/photosof-adamalicious/">Apple products</a>. "I've been using Macs since before it was a good idea to use one," he says. One of this writer's first (pre-Populi) encounters with Mr. Sentz involved the man's lengthy declamation on the anatomy of the original iPod's clickwheel; it is not uncommon to have Adam emerge from his office with monologues on the superiority of Apple to any company you might think of. Then there's his diet of <a href="http://daringfireball.net">tech blogs</a>, web apps, <a href="http://5by5.tv">podcasts</a>, and other sites that inform his understanding of the modern tech world and where Populi fits within that. Adam lives and breathes this stuff... although it must be added that he still drives his first car, a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/05/GTKU-Adams-Honda.jpg">1991 Honda Accord</a> with a groaning fuel pump and about 40% of the original Clearcoat remaining.</p>
<p>If Adam ever moves on from Populi, more than likely it would be a joint venture with Mark Ackerman. Mark, as we all know, would like to someday build a machine that assembles gourmet hamburgers from raw inputs*; Adam wishes to do the same, but with pizza, and the machine would be more of a humanoid robot. "But whatever I put my hands to," says he, pulling from a cup of high-end Japanese green tea, "I like the way we have things here. I'm my own boss, and I get to work with smart, talented people that I like."</p>
<blockquote><p>* Mark, however, is now engaged to be married, and his life goals ought to have changed some by now.</p></blockquote>
