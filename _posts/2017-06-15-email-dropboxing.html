<p>Email dropboxing lets Staff and Faculty users attach emails sent from outside Populi to a person's Activity Feed. It's been part of Populi <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2012/02/new-release-contact-organizations-and-a-few-other-things/">since Presidents' Day, 2012,</a> and we're soon to release an update that will introduce a few handy front-end and back-end improvements.</p>
<p>Here's a look at dropboxing from stem to stern—how to use it and how it will work after the update.</p>
<h5>Get your dropbox address</h5>

<p>To start using your dropbox, go to your personal Populi settings. Generate your dropbox address and create a contact for it in your non-Populi email program. That's it!</p>
<p>Oh, and make sure to keep your dropbox address to yourself—there's no need for anyone else to know it...</p>
<h5>BCC and forward emails to your dropbox</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog_email_dropbox_example.png" width="580" height="364" /></p>
<p>To use your dropbox, just BCC it when you send an email from an address listed in your Populi contact information. Or, if you receive an email you can just forward it to your dropbox. As long as you send it to email addresses listed for people in Populi...</p>
<ul>
<li>When you BCC an email, the message will attach to the activity feeds for anyone with email addresses that are in the <em>To</em> and <em>CC</em> fields.</li>
<li>When you forward a message, it will attach to the activity feed of the person who sent it to you. If you forward a message you previously sent, it will go to the activity feeds of the people to whom you earlier sent it.</li>
</ul>

<h5>New stuff and other details</h5>
<ul>
<li>Emails on activity feeds will include any reply chains—just click <em>read more</em> to see them.</li>
<li>If multiple people have an email address, Populi will pick someone to whom to attach it. You'll also get an email telling you who else <em>could</em> have had it attached together with links to profiles to fix any aberrant contact info.</li>
<li>If the email addresses aren't in Populi, then you'll get an email telling you so.</li>
