<p>For our first education-related post, a link to a story about <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/08/25/liberty">Liberty University's new snowpark</a>, which is located in <a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/local/USVA0453?lswe=Lynchburg,%20VA&amp;lwsa=Weather36HourOutdoorsCommand&amp;from=searchbox_typeahead">Lynchburg, Virginia</a>, a city that <em>might</em> get a few inches of snow in a really cold year. This one's listed under Bloggable, Education, and Uncategorized... because we're not really sure what to do with this.</p>
