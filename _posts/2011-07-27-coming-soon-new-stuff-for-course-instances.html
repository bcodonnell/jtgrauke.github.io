<p>In just a few weeks, we're planning to release an overhaul of course instances. From a complete navigation overhaul to some brand-new features to a second look at things we've been doing all along, the upcoming release will make courses a lot more intuitive, useful, and flexible. Have a look at some of the things we're doing:</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Navigation</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/New-Course-Navigation.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2160 aligncenter" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="New Course Navigation" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/New-Course-Navigation.png" alt="" width="510" height="52.8" /></a><br />
Courses are getting our new tab-based navigation, which we're slowly rolling out to all of Populi. As you can see from the screenshot, courses will feature the same basic items—assignments, lessons, gradebook, etc.—and certain actions (finalizing, for instance) will be subsumed under the appropriate tabs. Additionally, who you are will affect where you land when you navigate to a course—registrars and Admins will arrive at the Info tab, and students and faculty will come to the new course Dashboard.</p>
<h5>Dashboard</h5>
<p>The course Dashboard tells faculty and students what's happening now and what's coming up via Alerts, Schedule, Discussions, and a retooled Bulletin Board. Alerts notifies students about upcoming tests, assignments, and currently-available lessons, and informs faculty about test questions that need to be graded. Schedule draws from the new course calendar and displays upcoming course events (due dates, special meeting times, etc.). Discussions summarizes recent activity on course discussions. And the course Bulletin Board is getting updated with file uploads, comments, and a revamped interface.</p>
<h5>Online Learning</h5>
<p>A few new things are in store for online learning. Tests feature new question types—Matching and True/False. Discussions can now be course-wide or attached to a specific Lesson—and you can also attach files and images to comments and replies. And we're making improvements that will make video embedding in Lessons better than ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/Discussions.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2161" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Discussions" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/Discussions.png" alt="" width="510" height="612" /></a></p>
<h5>Assignments</h5>
<p>We've created three assignment types to simplify how you use them in your courses. <em>Test</em> assignments will automatically create a corresponding online test. <em>File</em> assignments feature a feed of comments and file uploads so teacher and student can interact about the assignment—they can even pass an essay back and forth with revisions and corrections. And regular assignments will simply be a graded assignment—perfect for things like completed readings.</p>
<h5>Calendar</h5>
<p>The new course calendar lets faculty, registrars, and academic admins add and update course events. Upcoming events display on the course Dashboard, and course calendars are seamlessly integrated with the corresponding calendars on Google Apps.</p>
<h5>Miscellany</h5>
<p>The new reporting tab features the Performance Dashboard and the course Change Log. Cloning and syncing are getting a minor retooling. And, we're also scrubbing the iTunes U integration. Few customers used it (it's probably Apple's clumsiest, most aggravating product)... and we have something much better in store.</p>
