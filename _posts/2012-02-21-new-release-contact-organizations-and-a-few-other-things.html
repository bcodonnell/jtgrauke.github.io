<p>The Populi crew took the evening of President's Day to release a bunch of new features. Here's a look at what we did...</p>
<h5><strong>New stuff in organizations</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-20-12-Org-Profile.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2272" title="2-20-12 Org Profile" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-20-12-Org-Profile.png" alt="" width="510" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>Organizations now have an Activity Feed; a Members tab to track members, employees, and students with that contact Org; custom info fields, and images.</p>
<h5><strong>Email</strong></h5>

<p>Email dropboxing is a new feature that lets you post email to a person's Activity Feed from any email client. Check out the video to learn more about how it works.</p>
<p>We also now provide bounce/spam reports for email addresses on Profiles.</p>
<h5>Personal settings<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-20-12-Settings.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2273" style="margin-left: 107px; margin-right: 107px;" title="2-20-12 Settings" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-20-12-Settings.png" alt="" width="396" height="271" /></a></h5>
<p>New personal settings let you select your local timezone, hide your profile from non-staff users, keep your birthday off the News Feed, as well as let you choose a default Activity Feed visibility setting and generate your email dropbox. We also moved your email signature here.</p>
<h5>Library</h5>
<p>Library got some new reports and workflows, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource batches and Inventory in the Catalog</li>
<li>Circulation reporting by loan, resource, resource type, home library, and home location</li>
<li>Browse resources is now exportable</li>
</ul>
<h5>Financial</h5>
<p>A few new financial items:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now bulk-add tuition schedules from the Data Slicer</li>
<li>Invoice and transaction numbers are now generated sequentially (previously they were generated every-other-number to avoid potential conflicts)</li>
<li>You can now print financial aid award letters</li>
<li>We loosened the financial aid workflow: you no longer need to package aid before invoicing charges to have the aid auto-apply to those charges</li>
<li>Overaward alerts now exclude declined financial aid</li>
<li>More detailed totals under Profile &gt; Financial Aid &gt; Summary &gt; Total Aid</li>
<li>A new setting lets you select the Term you wish to begin automatically generating pending chargesâ€”this will be really helpful for schools that want to back-enter financial and billing data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
