<p>At any given time, there may be 62 living creatures in Toby Robinson's office, give or take.</p>
<p>The biggest (and most important, of course) is Toby, who handles Customer Support, live trainings, and software testing. Next biggest is Toby's bearded dragon, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2010/11/Dennis-blog.jpg">Dennis</a>, who lives in an aquarium with a decorative tree branch and a flat grey rock set under a warm lamp. And then there are about 60 live crickets. The crickets spend their days in an adjacent aquarium, where they rub their hind legs together and contribute to the Populi office's outdoorsy feel. The existential among them mope around as they consider the inevitable; every few days Toby plucks them up, five at a time, and drops them into Dennis' aquarium to be devoured.</p>
<p>"Thing is, Dennis can be kinda lazy," remarks Toby. "I came in one morning and none of the crickets I'd left him the night before had been eaten. One, in fact, was perched on his head, right below the lamp."</p>

<p>Against the background noise of crickets, in the company of a lazy dragon, Toby spends a good part of his workday testing Populi. He reviews all the changes made to Populi's code—which might affect what buttons show up where, the back-end calculations that create GPAs, or how quickly server requests are handled... to name but a few things. Code-wise, nothing gets out into the wild without it passing under Toby's scrutiny. If something's not working properly, he sends it back to the programmers for repair. They, in turn, slide a fix or upgrade back down the counter to him for more testing. The process has given him a deep expertise on how Populi works, which in turn helps him field customer support requests. The requests range from simple question-answering (How do I do this...?) to technical problems (I think there's a bug...) that need attention from a programmer.</p>
<p>Like everyone at Populi, Toby formerly worked at <a href="http://www.economicmodeling.com/">EMSI</a>. His duties focused on the testing and construction of their enormous, complicated economic databases—as well as the web-based tools used to access them. Previous to that, he drew pay as a gardener, bouncer, farmhand, and even as a sandpaper-maker at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3m+prairie+du+chien+wi&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=3m&amp;hnear=Prairie+du+Chien,+Crawford,+Wisconsin&amp;t=h&amp;z=14">3M plant in Prarie du Chien, Wisconsin</a>. He moved to Idaho to attend New Saint Andrews College and dabble in computer science and biology at the University of Idaho. A few years in, he met and married <a href="http://bugbeer.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/emily-and-david.jpg">Emily, mother to their new son, David</a>, and who also attended the New England Culinary Institute. "Since getting married my diet has gone from boiled hot dogs to grilled, local-grown lamb chops covered in fresh rosemary and thyme with a  Greek orzo salad accompanied by my home brewed apfelwein."</p>
<p>Indeed, one of Toby's great off-hours preoccupations is <a href="http://bugbeer.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/march09-2621.jpg">homebrewing beer</a>, cider, and even a little wine. He believes he got started when he was a little boy. "I always pretended to be an alchemist as a child, mixing dirt and water  and pollen from dandelions to make 'concoctions'.  Home brewing is pretty similar: you take this sludgey yeast, mix it with ground grain  and hops, alter the ratios from batch to batch, and experiment by adding things like orange peels or coffee or ground toasted coriander seeds. Each batch can be really different from the last." Toby and Emily's respective epicurean interests intersect as often as possible; a few nights before this writing, they sat down to a supper of "pot roast cooked in [Toby's] own oatmeal stout."</p>
<p>Toby's various interests—critters, homebrew, and software testing—aren't that far apart in his mind. His brewing website and private-label beer is called <a href="http://bugbeer.com/">Bugbeer</a>. And, of course, he does spend his days combing Populi code for bugs (oof... so sorry). He connects beermaking and software at an even deeper level. "When you're formulating a new brew, you have to think of all the ingredients in relation to each other. Too many <a href="http://bugbeer.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/march09-144.jpg">specialty grains</a> can overcome the diastatic power of your pale malts and ruin your beer. The same with cooking. How much salt is too much? Is balsamic vinegar and watermelon really a good idea? (Yes, it is!) This is also true for the testing environment. While one change may seem trivial, it oftentimes touches every part of Populi—its different parts are so interconnected. The simplest line of code, improperly handled, can ruin the whole experience and leave a sour taste in your mouth. Just the same, that same line of code, deployed in just the right way, can be a very sweet thing."</p>
