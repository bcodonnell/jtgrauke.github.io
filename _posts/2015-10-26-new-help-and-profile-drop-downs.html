<p>We just released a small but handy update to the personal and help links in Populi. Here's an eleven-second video:</p>
<p><iframe name="quickcast" src="http://quick.as/embed/konbtobbl" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" width="426" height="291" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Your name now has a drop-down that lets you go to your profile, view and update your personal account settings, and log out of Populi.</p>
<p>The orange Help button now lets you link directly to different, helpful tasks in our Knowledge Base:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go straight to the Populi Support home page</li>
<li>Open a new support request</li>
<li>Search for articles in the Knowledge Base</li>
<li>Make a feature request</li>
<li>Check out the user forum</li>
</ul>
<p>Small things can prove pretty helpful sometimes. We hope you like the new drop-downs!</p>
