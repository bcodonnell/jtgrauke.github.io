<p>Our Billing and Financial Aid users have probably noticed by now that <strong>we've re-jiggered Populi Billing a little bit.</strong> Here's a rundown of the new features.</p>
<ol>
<li>The new <strong>Chart of Accounts</strong> lets you define<strong> </strong>and manage all of your accounts directly, improving on our previous use of "external accounts" which reconciled Populi with your main accounting package.</li>
<li>Piggybacking on that, by entering all your bank accounts as Asset accounts, <strong>you can record exactly where each student payment should be deposited.</strong></li>
<li>For deposit reconciliation, Populi's <strong>new General Ledger report</strong> lets you choose a custom timeframe and see the total debits and credits for that period. Assuming that payments have been recorded in the appropriate accounts, you can <strong>verify the amount of tuition/fees</strong> you're taking to the bank.</li>
<li>Financial Aid awards are now linked to Liability accounts, allowing you to <strong>more accurately trace the flow</strong> of Financial Aid money from the source to the student.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other, numerous improvements to Billing</strong> mean that Populi, used in concert with a good fund-based accounting package, will more fully manage your General Fund—in particular, your Accounts Receivable. And with the automation between Academics and Billing going even further, hopefully <strong>your day will be that much easier.</strong></p>
