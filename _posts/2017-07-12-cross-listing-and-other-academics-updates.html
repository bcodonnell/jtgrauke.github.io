<p>The Populi developers have been cranking out new academics features at a steady clip. Here's a look at some of what's new:</p>
<h5>Cross Listing</h5>

<p>You can now cross-list courses at the course instance level. After adding a course to an academic term, you can then cross-list it with other courses right on the Info view. Cross-listed courses let you set up assignments for students in one course or the other; otherwise, they share all course content, meeting times, faculty, and so on.</p>
<h5>Registration lottery</h5>

<p>The new advanced options for online enrollment let you introduce a delay/lottery for student registrations. You can set all registrations to process at a certain date and time, and randomize submitted registrations so that the earlier requests aren't prioritized over the later ones.</p>
<h5>Custom Student ID numbers</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog_student_id_custom.png"><img class="aligncenter " src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog_student_id_custom.png" width="611" height="130" /></a></p>
<p>You can now customize the Student ID numbers automatically-generated by Populi when you create new students. You can include variables for last name, month/day/year, random numbers, and sequential number counters. If you want to set that up for your school, start by reading <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000169134">this article</a>.</p>
<h5>Release notes</h5>
