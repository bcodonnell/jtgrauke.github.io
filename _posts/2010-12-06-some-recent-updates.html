<p><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/10/recent-tidbits/"><strong>Our feature trickle continues.</strong></a> In the midst of working on some pretty big upgrades and brand-new features, we've been fixing bugs, tweaking the interface, and putting some spit-and-polish on the functions deep inside Populiâ€”the stuff that makes the front-end run better. Of some note, regular Staff users can now add News Articles that are visible to Students. We pushed an update for the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/populi/id307818270">iPhone App</a> to fix an attendance-taking bug some instructors have bumped into. IPEDS reporting for the Winter &amp; Fall Enrollment and Fall Completions series received some general improvements.</p>
<p>We've also released some improvements to online tests. Students can now review their answers for tests they've already taken. And instructors can now share Test Questions between Courses!</p>
<p>And there's a lot more to come in the near future...</p>
