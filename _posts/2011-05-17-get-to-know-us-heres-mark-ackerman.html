<p>Should you ever find yourself reading his resum√©, you will learn that Mark Ackerman is qualified by the Unites States Navy to monitor diesel propulsion plants. "Ah, neat," you will think. Then you learn that the United States Department of Energy has also certified him to operate nuclear-electrical distribution plants. If it's a cold morning and you're trying to get your nuclear guided missile submarine out of the driveway, you could call Mark and he'd be able to help you. Or, at least, he's certified to help you.<br />

<p>Mark brushes it off. "There ain't much interesting to the nuke stuff. I spent two years sitting in a classroom learning to do something I never ended up doing. Instead of getting a submarine assignment, I ended up at the Naval Academy." The hollowness of the achievement notwithstanding, the fact that he can man the engine room in a nuclear boat testifies to Mark's skill and attention to critical detail. Because Mark, in a company that requires something of the polymath in all of us, bears the titles of Chief Financial Officer and Data Implementation Manager.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mark has some of the most intensive and crucial jobs here at Populi. On any given day he might...</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with the multitude of schools for whom he's migrating legacy data</li>
<li>Jump in on a sales call to talk databases with prospective customers</li>
<li>Adjust monthly billing forecasts to reflect new business</li>
<li>Write a conversion script that translates data from old CSV files into Populi's SQL databases</li>
<li>Answer customer support calls</li>
<li>Update the query that creates your Populi invoice</li>
</ul>
<p>...plus variations on those themes. He also serves as secretary on the Populi Board and hopes to commence development work on some new stuff for the API. Mark has a full plate.</p>
<p>Before coming to Populi, the man spent six years in the Navy as an electrician. "My favorite thing in the Navy was being stationed in Bahrain," he says, "because the McDonald's there serves something called the <a href="http://www.metapedia.com/wiki/images/MCARABIA_CHICK.jpg">McArabia sandwich</a>." In the middle of this exotic, delicious stint, he interned for the <a href="http://bartlett.house.gov/">Hon. Roscoe G. Bartlett</a> of the 6th District in Maryland, for whom he analyzed energy data, prepared PowerPoints for Congress, and honed his customer service chops by fielding gripes from constituents. At the conclusion of his Navy stretch, he considered synthesizing biodiesel using expired fry grease and a semi-toxic succulent called Jatropha. Instead he ended up here in Moscow working for EMSI, who put him to work on their stadium-sized economic databases. He also completed a <a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/features/students/Mark%20Ackerman">BS in Business Finance at the University of Idaho</a>, which gave him opportunities to manage funds, trade options, and gaze into the ink-black box behind modern corporate finance.</p>
<p>Other doors were open to him, but Mark came aboard with Populi a few months after the creation of the company. "Sure, I could have gone to Chicago or Wall Street to make gobs of money working for a hedge fund. But here, I actually get to create value, rather than just intermediate it. It's gratifying to know that Populi can help colleges simplify and streamline their internal processes," he says. Despite abjuring professional trading, Mark keeps a few fingers in finance. His best performer is the Apple stock he bought in 2004 for twenty-something a share. It's worth a bit more than that <a href="http://investor.apple.com/stockquote.cfm">now</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the high-flying price of his favorite stock, Mark's life ambitions remain modest. "At the end of the day, when everyone leaves the office, I bust out my standup bass or my guitar." Indeed, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/05/Music.jpg">the area around his desk</a> is stacked high with instruments and amplifiers; every few weeks he totes the whole lot to a gig with one of several bands he plays in. Gracing the Populi parking lot is his 1967 Mustang, a pretty red thing that could use some work. "I like the idea of working on it, but all I've ever done is watch <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/10/get-to-know-us-heres-nick-holloway/">Nick Holloway</a> change my brakes," shrugs Mark.<br />
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/05/mustang.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2111" title="mustang" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/05/mustang.jpg" alt="" width="609" height="343" /></a></p>
<p>But there's also something of the problem-solving visionary in Mark, a side of him we here at Populi are privileged to work around, even if we only see it in glimpses. Almost off-handedly, his eyes looking out at the field across from our office, or perhaps the expanse of blue Idaho sky above it, he says, "I used to really want to build a battlebot, but now I really want to make a machine that takes raw ingredients as inputs and assembles hamburgers. Building a battlebot that can fight and make hamburgers at the same time is probably my life goal."</p>
