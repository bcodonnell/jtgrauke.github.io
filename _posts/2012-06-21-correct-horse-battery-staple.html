<p>Here's a fine comic from <a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> that made the rounds a few months ago. We confess to being guilty as charged as to encouraging users to concoct passwords like Tr0ub4dor&amp;3—while then telling everyone not to post it on a sticky note on your monitor. Passwords like <em>correct horse battery staple</em> are certainly much simpler to remember. Of course, we do require an uppercase letter and a number somewhere in your password, but that should be easy enough to work into a more memorable password.</p>
<p>Here's a much more technical article going into the why's and what's and how's of such passwords from the <a href="http://tech.dropbox.com/?p=165">Dropbox tech blog</a>.</p>
