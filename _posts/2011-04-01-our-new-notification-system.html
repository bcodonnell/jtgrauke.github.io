<p>We're also squeezing in another new feature today: <strong>Populi's in-app notification system.</strong><br />
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/04/notification.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2062" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="notification" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/04/notification.png" alt="" width="510" height="35.4" /></a>It's a tool we'll use to let you know about new features, planned outages, and other notes of interest. It targets specific user roles, so if we release something chiefly of interest to, say, Admissions, we won't bother students with the notice. Usually it'll link to something that goes into more detail, like this blog or our <a title="http://twitter.com/populi" href="http://twitter.com/populi">Twitter feed</a>. We think it'll be a great way to keep all of our users up to date on what's going on with Populi.</p>
