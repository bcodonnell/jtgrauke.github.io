<p>About thirty percent of our Customer Support requests, surprisingly enough, have nothing to do with the software. Today alone we received about a dozen requests not really related to Populi at all. Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey, a bunch of us have been wondering what the Populi staff would look like with Bieber-hair. Can you guys jump on that? Thank you for giving priority attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Our 13-year-old registrar has a very important Feature Request: the Populi staff should all get Justin Bieber haircuts. Thanks for all your hard work!</p>
<p>Hey, what do you guys look like with Justin Bieber hair? Please advise.</p>
<p>Populi's great and all, but... I just feel like I'm NEVER gonna see what you guys look like with awesome Justin Bieber hair :(</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, folks, all we can say is... Never Say Never. A friend slipped us some SuperCuts coupons and we took the plunge... because <a href="http://populi.co/about/support">Customer Support</a> is the backbone of what we do.</p>
