<p>We've been working on a lot of things lately—some big, some little—one of which is a just-now-released integration with <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a>. Scribd is a web-based service that lets you upload documents, slideshows, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. into an easily-embeddable and shareable format. If you get a Scribd account (they're free!), you can upload files there and share them in Populi just by pasting the URL in a News item, Course Dashboard, Lesson, or Discussion.</p>
