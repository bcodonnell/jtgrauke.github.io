<p>There are a lot of new buttons and links in Populi today, and just about all of them say... <em>Text</em>.</p>
<p>Texting is now almost as common in Populi as email. Formerly, it handled emergency notifications and password retrieval for staff and faculty (of course, it still does that!). Now, it does a lot more. Need to tell a prof's students that he's out sick and class is canceled? Text his students right from the course roster. Wanna send a quick <em>thank you</em> to your $100-$250 donors? Use the <em>Text</em><em> donors</em> button in the Donations report. Have an accepted applicant you want to tell the good news? Now you can send her a text right from the accept application dialog.</p>

<p>The new features give your admissions staff swifter ways to communicate with leads. When an inquiry or applicant fills out the initial form, they can verify their mobile/text number on the spot. You can then respond to their questions via text, and they can reply in turn. And when you accept an applicant, you can import her verified number right into her profile.</p>
<p>We want to make communication at your school as friction-free as possible, and we're really pleased to give you these new texting features. If you'd like to get your Populi user account set up to receive text notifications from your school, <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/entries/102104133">read this article</a>. And if you want to keep an eye on how many texts your school has sent so far this month, have a look at Communications &gt; Campus Notifications (remember that additional texts are 2¢ each).</p>
