<p><strong>Phil Wainewright</strong> is a consultant with Procullux Ventures and an advocate of "cloud computing" and the "Software as a Service" (SaaS) model.Â  We appreciate his (sometimes pugilistic) <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?tag=trunk;content"><strong>declamations on cloud computing</strong></a>, but we came across a paragraph of his this morning that we thought was worth quoting (with some emphasis added). You can find the original post (from November 15th, 2009) <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/SAAS/?p=932&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+zdnet%2FSAAS+%28ZDNet+Software+as+services%29"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet despite our understandable caution, <strong>it is far better to trust the cloud,</strong> where security and performance are <strong>continuously open to public scrutiny,</strong> where costs can be predictably mapped to actual value delivered and where <strong>the technology is constantly kept up-to-date for no extra cost</strong> or disruption to the customer. Provided the buyer makes proper due diligence and precautions, there is in my view <strong>no alternative form of computing that is more trustworthy.</strong></p></blockquote>
