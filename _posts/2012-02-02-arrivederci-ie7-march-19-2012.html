<p>On March 19th, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_explorer_8">Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 turns three</a>. On that same day, Populi will <strong>drop support for Internet Explorer 7</strong>, which will be 5½ years old at that time.</p>
<h5>Why are we dropping IE7?</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="The decline in use of IE7" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2r2r0c2i2Y1g1G0e2x2a/Screen%20Shot%202012-02-02%20at%201.05.47%20PM.png" alt="" width="521" height="304" /></p>
<p>A number of tightly-intertwined reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's an old browser that doesn't comply with modern web standards</li>
<li>It's old and slow and buggy, not to mention full of horrifying <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=ie7%20security%20problems">security vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li>Very few people use it any more—it accounts for about 2.3% of Populi logins (see the above chart)</li>
<li>Its worldwide <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/ie/b/ie/archive/2010/11/01/ie9-gains-momentum-with-tech-sites-october-share.aspx">usage is dropping</a>*, and it's unlikely that future customers will be using it</li>
<li>Continued support of IE7 diverts resources away from more worthwhile long-term projects</li>
</ul>
<h5>What should you do?</h5>
<p>If you're using Internet Explorer 7, it's time to stop! IE7 doesn't just have problems with Populi—it doesn't play nice with a good part of the internet, and it's only going to get worse. <strong>The solution is easy:</strong> download one of these free web browsers (links below). It'll take just a few minutes and make for a much better online experience overall.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a></strong></h4>
<h4><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a></strong></h4>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a></strong></h4>
<p>And if you're running Windows Vista or 7, you can also try <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home">IE9</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>*In this article, Microsoft itself says that it is "pleased IE6 and IE7 usage share continues to drop (by 0.85% in October); it’s an indication that customers recognize the benefits they can realize when using a modern browser."</p></blockquote>
