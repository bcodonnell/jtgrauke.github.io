<p>If you've been watching our <a href="http://populi.co/contact/">contact page</a> like a hawk you may have already noticed a new face. We're pleased to announce Emily Hoos (like <em>hose—</em>as opposed to <em>whose</em>) has joined our team to take on a variety of roles from bookkeeping to event planning to making our new office a more hospitable place.</p>

<p>Today is her one-monthaversary here at Populi and she's already taken over daily bookkeeping, ordered furniture for our spartan lobby, planned our Fall party, and procured a simply <em>spectacular</em> beverage selection for our break room. Yeah, we made a good call.</p>
