<p>Though he does love to sing, Nick Holloway couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. "I  have a horrible—<em>horrible</em>—singing voice," says Nick. But at least it's loud. Deafening, even. His sales-demo voice, clear and booming, once drowned out a customer who was calling the support line. Nick was in his office, the door shut, a sound-dampening tartan pinned on one side. The support guy fled to another office with his headset, shut that door, <em>plugged his other ear</em>—<strong>and still could only hear Nick</strong>.<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2010/10/IMG_1460.jpg"></a></p>

<p>For as long as Populi has been presentable to the public, Nick has put his voice to use as our lead evangelist and salesman. As salesman, he contacts colleges, walks the curious through a live demo, and if they're still interested, he shows them more demos until Populi convinces them to move forward. "Honestly, I just let Populi speak for itself. It makes a convincing case to a lot of schools," Nick says. "The schools it doesn't convince usually need something else altogether." Periodically, Nick jumps in on Customer Support and gets reacquainted with some of his old contacts answering their support requests.</p>
<p>Nick grew up in "the most beautiful place on earth"—<a href="http://beautifulhoodriver.com/index.php?showimage=195"><strong>Hood River, Oregon</strong></a> (truly, a superlatively beautiful place)—where the brooding rains of the Pacific Northwest break up into the dry, sunny skies of the rain shadow cast by the Cascade Mountains. Apple orchards rejoice in the mix of weather, as do <a href="http://beautifulhoodriver.com/index.php?showimage=162"><strong>windsurfers</strong></a>: terrific winds funnel through the <strong><a href="http://beautifulhoodriver.com/index.php?showimage=192">Columbia River Gorge</a> </strong>and crescendo at Hood River. Perennially-glaciated <a href="http://beautifulhoodriver.com/index.php?showimage=187"><strong>Mt. Hood</strong></a>—playground of skiers, beacon to aviators, <a href="http://beautifulhoodriver.com/index.php?showimage=115"><strong>maker of its own weather</strong></a>—loomed above it all. In this context Nick spent his days hiking, windsurfing, and snowboarding; playing baseball and football; working in his father's orchard and fighting summertime fires for the U.S. Forest Service. After graduating from <a href="http://www.lclark.edu/"><strong>Lewis &amp; Clark College</strong></a> in Portland and pulling in a ThM from <a href="http://www.dts.edu/"><strong>Dallas Theological Seminary</strong></a>, Nick hoofed it over to China for over a year's worth of traveling, teaching, and eating. Concerning things eaten, Nick enjoyed the "live silk worms, live shrimp, and dog" much more than the traditionally delectable Peking Duck, which gave him food poisoning and morbid thoughts of dying "alone in [his] sad Communist apartment in Dalian, China."</p>
<p>After returning to the States, Nick married <a href="http://hollowayfam.blogspot.com/2010/10/abby-nick-go-out-to-dinner.html"><strong>Abby</strong></a>, upon whom he'd long had his eye set. For most of their early married life they taught high school around Portland—Abby handling Spanish and Nick's voice booming out lessons in history and economics. During football season, his workdays could stretch to 14 hours with his coaching duties. After a few years, they moved to Idaho to raise their children; as of this writing, the Holloways boast three little ones: <a href="http://hollowayfam.blogspot.com/2010/09/signe-at-top-of-ferris-wheel.html">Signe</a>, <a href="http://hollowayfam.blogspot.com/2010/10/ice-skating_548.html">Gunnar</a>, and <a href="http://hollowayfam.blogspot.com/2010/10/b-zay-rides-tonka-truck.html">Zane</a>. When he's not hugging his daughter or wrassling the two boys, Nick gets his sports fix officiating regional high school football and baseball games. He still pines for the <a href="http://beautifulhoodriver.com/index.php?showimage=174"><strong>Great River of the Northwest</strong></a>, but takes comfort in his new proximity to Idaho's Snake River and Hell's Canyon... and he's still not that far from Oregon, particularly the Wallowa Mountains and their peerless wilderness areas.</p>
<p>The move also brought Nick to Populi and an opportunity to change professions. "Moving from teaching to sales, I wasn't sure how well I would enjoy or  appreciate the job. I had a poor impression of salesmen-types, and I didn't want to be <em>that guy</em>. I also figured that my  impression was similar to what other people thought. So, from the start, I knew my main task was to avoid doing all the stuff that creates that impression—and not just that, but to also genuinely help people and sell them something they want and need," says Nick.</p>
<p>"And, I gotta say, avoiding all that salesman-nonsense—just talking straight, serving people, not being <em>pushy</em>—well, I've come to love this job."</p>
