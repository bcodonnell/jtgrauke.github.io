<p>We updated the 1098-T report with a bunch of new features last week. Here's what you need to know...</p>
<h5>First things first</h5>
<p>On January 1 of every year, Populi takes all the billing and financial aid information you've entered for your students and automatically generates a 1098-T form. The 1098-T report lets you review, release, and export these forms with tools that, conservatively, save you <em>days</em> of work. We keep an eye on the IRS regulations and make sure that the forms Populi generates comply with whatever new rules and minutiae those industrious pencil-pushers have scribbled into existence. And with the new features, you now have more tools at your disposal to get these forms off your to-do list.</p>
<p>Simply put, Populi does all the rote stuff so you don't have to.</p>
<h5>They're compliant</h5>
<p>Submitting a 1098-T to the IRS with a bad Social Security Number is what is known in higher ed accounting as a "big fat no-no". We've done a few things to help prevent that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Populi flags students with no SSN or an obvious "placeholder" number (e.g. <em>123-45-6789</em>). It then prevents forms from being released to students who are so flagged. Meanwhile, you know exactly who's SSN's you need to update.</li>
<li>There's a new checkbox that lets you indicate that you've complied with regulation section 1.6050S-1; said regulation requires you to hunt down the Taxpayer Identification Number (usually just the SSN) for your 1098-T students. This corresponds to the newly-scribbled-into-existence checkbox on the IRS forms.</li>
<li>Before exporting, you have to release the forms! Exporting unreleased forms frequently leads to a lot of sorrow and heartache, and in the interest of sparing you, we've closed that door.</li>
</ul>
<h5>They're adjustable!</h5>
<p>Sometimes, you just gotta adjust a 1098-T. This frequently happens with schools that get started with Populi mid-year or maintain financial records in something like Quickbooks. Now you can adjust the Populi-generated values for any unreleased 1098-T right on the report, a feat that used to require a support request. Changes are recorded to preserve the audit trail, and you can even indicate a voided or corrected form using the adjuster doohickey.</p>
<h5>They're un-releasable!</h5>
<p>After releasing a form, sometimes you wish you could just... <em>un</em>release a form—perhaps you catch an error, or you realize the student doesn't merit a 1098-T this year. Whatever the case, in former times you'd have to get Populi Support on the horn to do such a thing. Now there's a new <em>Hide/Unrelease</em> function in the Actions menu that puts the task on your own timetable.</p>
<p>Thus, the new features (we also put out a bunch of under-the-hood improvements, too). For all the details and how-to's, head over to the <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/223792907/#1098t">Populi Knowledge Base</a>, or fire off a question to the support crew.</p>
