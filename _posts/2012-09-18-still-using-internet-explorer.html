<p>Yesterday, Microsoft <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2757760">reported on a security vulnerability</a> in versions 6, 7, 8, and 9 of Internet Explorer that "could allow remote code execution", which is a nicer way of saying, "could allow someone to take over your computer".</p>
<p>To address the vulnerability, they list a number of complicated "workarounds" and "suggested actions", all of which seem to include continued use of Internet Explorer while it has a serious, un-patched security hole.</p>
<p>Since around 23% of our users choose to access Populi from Internet Explorer, we thought we'd offer a suggestion of our own: switch to <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a>Â or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?from=getfirefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>.</p>
