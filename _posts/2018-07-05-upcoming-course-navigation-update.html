<p>We&#8217;re soon to release an update to the navigation in Populi courses. The long and the short of it is that the navigation views are moving from the top to the left side of the screen. We&#8217;re not changing where you&#8217;ll find anything&mdash;assignments will still be found in <em>Assignments</em>, discussions will still dwell in <em>Discussions</em>, and so on. But if your muscle memory sends you to the top of the screen, you&#8217;ll need to retrain your wrists and index fingers to swing leftward.</p>


<p>Why the change? In a word: room! We have been adding to the number of things in courses over time, and there just wasn&#8217;t enough room for more navigation along the top of the screen anymore.</p>

<p>Thus, the sidebar: it gives us more room to add new stuff<sup>*</sup> to courses and gives the whole layout a bit more breathing room. (Oh, and now there&#8217;s room for a course picture...) Otherwise, your courses will look and feel much as they always have.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re planning to release the navigation update in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup> See if you can spot one of the new things we&#8217;re working on in the screenshot...</p>
