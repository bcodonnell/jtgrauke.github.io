<p>Google <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2011/06/our-plans-to-support-modern-browsers.html">recently announced</a> that they'll be dropping Google Apps support for older browsers on August 1:</p>
<blockquote><p>As of August 1st, we will <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=37560">discontinue support</a> for the following browsers and their predecessors: Firefox 3.5,  Internet Explorer 7, and Safari 3.  In these older browsers you may have  trouble using certain features in Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Talk,  Google Docs and Google Sites, and eventually these apps may stop working  entirely.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there's one thing we always jump up and down about, it's that you should keep your browser updated. Browser updates improve security and functionality, and as more and more of our work moves to the web, this is more and more of a crucial issue. You could say we're pleased with Google's decision in this area because of the incremental improvement it may help bring to the web as a whole.</p>
<p>So, if you're using Google Apps for Education (with which we integrate, in case you didn't know), you'll need to make sure you're running an up-to-date version of a supported browser on August 1. That's about seven weeks away! To give you a leg up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Download Safari<br />
</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Download Chrome<br />
</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Download Firefox</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(Since we're giving you a leg up, we're not providing a link to download Internet Explorer... though we do support IE8 and IE9)</p>
