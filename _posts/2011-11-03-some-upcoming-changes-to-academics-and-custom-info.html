<p>Our next release will update Academics to our new tabbed navigation layout:</p>

<p>We're also changing a few things with Custom Info fields. You'll soon find Custom Fields divided among the appropriate sections of Populi. Student Fields will be found in Academics, Prospect and Application Fields will soon dwell in Admissions, and Person Fields will remain in Admin:</p>

<p>We have a few other low-key items we're working on, but we've found that even the small stuff can make a big difference in our customers' days. We're looking forward to making Populi even better.</p>
