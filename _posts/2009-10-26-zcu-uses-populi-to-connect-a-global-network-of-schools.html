<p>We occasionally like to share snapshots of how Populi is easing the workload for our customers. We recently spoke with <strong>Daniel </strong><strong>Humphreys at <a href="http://www.zion.edu/">Zion Christian University</a></strong> in Clearwater, Florida, who uses Populi to <strong>share information across an international network</strong> of ZCU-affiliated colleges.</p>
<p>It started with<strong> ZCU's Global Network program</strong> which connects the University with Bible schools, missionaries, and churches that wish to use ZCU's curriculum to train <!--more-->their own students. Affiliates have access to counsel, coursework, textbooks, and other resources; further, they offer their students certificates, diplomas, and degrees issued by ZCU.</p>
<p>Well, <strong>it's difficult enough to keep track of your own students' degree audits.</strong> But put yourself in Daniel's shoes and imagine doing so for students at other institutions around the world! Starting off with a <strong>homegrown database,</strong> and later moving on to <strong>an unwieldy academic software tool,</strong> Daniel was stuck manually entering all sorts of academic information for each student—students located in places all around the world. You can <strong>imagine the complexity</strong> of this very routine task.</p>
<p>Things have gotten <strong>a lot simpler</strong> since he started using Populi.</p>
<p>Once ZCU's course catalog was migrated into Populi during implementation, Daniel was free to set up all of ZCU's degree requirements up front. <strong>With Populi accessible via the web,</strong> he simply gave access to designated users at ZCU's various global affiliates. They then entered their own students' information, and <strong>Populi handled the rest.</strong> As students completed courses and earned degree credit, <strong>Populi kept track of it all</strong>—with no effort on Daniel's part—on each student's <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/tour/academics"><strong>Degree Audit</strong></a>. Now Daniel—not to mention the students and their advisors—can see any student's completed courses, what remains to be taken, and how close each student is to earning their degree, <strong>all with one click.</strong></p>
<p>The Degree Audit has <strong>saved Daniel a ton of time,</strong> which is what Populi is all about.</p>
