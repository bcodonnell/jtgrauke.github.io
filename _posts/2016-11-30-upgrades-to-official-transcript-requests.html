<p>After releasing transcript requests <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2016/10/official-transcript-requests-and-an-interface-change/">a few weeks ago</a>, we heard a lot of good ideas from our customers about how we could round out the feature. So last night we released a bunch of handy upgrades to official transcript requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students who aren't in Populi (say, a 1960's-era alum whose transcript has to be mimeographed) can now request and pay for an official transcript. You can fulfill the request outside Populi, but then keep a record of the request and its completion—even if the student himself isn't in Populi at all.</li>
<li>Custom delivery methods let you handle "rush" requests. Just create a delivery method and tie it to a fee rule—and now you can properly charge for that transcript the student needs to be overnighted to Stockholm University.</li>
<li>Web transcripts are now disabled when the student has a grade/transcript or financial lock. There's also an access counter in the export history so you can see how many times they've been downloaded.</li>
<li>The request detail page now shows you any locks and outstanding financial balances that might make you want to not complete the request. It also has a new <em>cancel/</em><em>refund</em> function for credit card charges.</li>
<li>You can embed the request form within another web page and use custom CSS to make it match.</li>
<li>A new academic setting lets you customize the email that's sent when a transcript request is fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
