<p>We're currently hard at work on our upcoming release, which will focus mainly on back-end improvements to how Populi handles Academics. At the same time, we're also gonna be rolling out our improved navigation scheme to more of the program, starting with Admissions. Here's a video that takes a brief look at what we're doing with our navigation... and which gives you an idea of how we like to constantly re-evaluate our design decisions in pursuit of something better.</p>
