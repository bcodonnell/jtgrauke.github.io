<p>
	New Search is here! After about a month in public beta, Populi&#8217;s new search engine is now live for everyone. 
</p>

<p>
	Here&#8217;s a video overview we made when the public beta started. Since then, thanks to your feedback, we&#8217;ve made a number of tweaks and improvements
	including the triumphant return of phoenetic matching. It&#8217;s good now. Really.
