<p>We're shortly to release some improvements to Financial Aid that we thought merited a heads-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aid application student view gives students a couple new tools. In the section where students can accept and reject aid award offers, they can now <em>decrease</em> the loan amount they wish to accept. Additionally, each award includes estimated disbursement dates.</li>
<li>We've added a couple new ways to catch mismatches between the enrollment status on a student's aid application and the student's actual enrollment. There's a <em>mismatch</em> indicator on the Aid Applications report to help you spot such students. Additionally, financial aid users can opt-in to receive emailed alerts of such mismatches.</li>
<li>Financial Aid &gt; Reporting now includes a FISAP report that lets you export the raw data.</li>
<li>The built-in Stafford Loan has been renamed <em>Direct Loan</em>, to better comport with what it has been called for, oh, the past five years.</li>
</ul>
<p>These improvements, plus some behind-the-scenes upgrades, should be going live in the wee hours of March 9, 2017.</p>
