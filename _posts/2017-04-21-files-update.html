<p>We're soon to release a big update to Files. Here's a look at what's coming...</p>
<h5>Subfolders</h5>

<p>It's one of our top feature requests: subfolders. Just like the name sounds, it's a folder within a folder that helps you better organize your files. Of course, we also added functions that let you move or copy files from one folder to another.</p>
<h5>More storage</h5>

<p>Previously, every user at your school was given 50 MB of file storage. With the update, your school's Populi Account Administrator can set file storage limits by user role. For example, you could give faculty 2 GB of file storage and limit students to 500 MB.</p>
<h5>Improved file sharing</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog_share_folder.png" width="609" height="266" /></p>
<p>Sharing files is much improved. You can send files to other Populi users or share folders with individuals and people with certain user roles. When sharing folders, you can specify what level of access a role or person has—they can view files, edit (add new ones, delete, rename, etc.), or manage (share the folder with others, for example).</p>
<h5>Large file uploader, viewer, and file options</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog_file_upload.png" width="400" height="456" /></p>
<p>We updated the file uploader—now you can easily upload big files by dragging-and-dropping (the same way you can in courses and other places in Populi). Audio and video files play right from the built-in media viewer. The document viewer lets you look at PDFs, images, word documents, spreadsheets, and more right in your browser. And if you need to download, send, rename, or delete the file, those functions are near at hand.</p>
<h5>A few notes</h5>
<p>We're moving the Files link up into the top-level navigation bar (it's currently next to the <em>My Profile</em> tab).</p>
<p>In the old Files, you would upload files into the Shared folder and specify which user roles could access that item. To accommodate the update and its expanded pallette of folders and sharing features, we'll transfer your shared files into new shared folders for each user role (or combination) with which you've shared a file. For example, if you've shared some files with <em>faculty</em> and others with <em>faculty and advisors, </em>those files will be transferred to two new folders: one called <em>Shared with faculty</em> and the other called <em>Shared with faculty and advisors</em>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact Populi support.</p>
