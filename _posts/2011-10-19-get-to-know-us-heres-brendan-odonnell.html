<p>Before becoming a responsible adult, Brendan O'Donnell used to ride freight trains. "<a href="http://onthathill.tumblr.com/tagged/trains">I dig trains</a>. I'd chase them around with my camera, but one day I realized that taking pictures just wasn't cutting it any more," he said. His first ride commenced in <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/10/9361.1283550156.jpg">Brattleboro, Vermont</a> on the New England Central's nightly southbound. But soon after he snuck into an open boxcar, the brakeman happened by. "He shined his flashlight in and just asked, 'Wanna ride in the cab?' He was a grumpy Vietnam vet, but he had a soft spot for hoboes," remembers Brendan. "So my first ride was in the locomotive with the guys I was supposed to be hiding from."<br />

Nowadays, Brendan is Populi's chief writer, handling documentation, website copy, official documents, and the Populi Blog; he also chips in with Customer Support and software testing. "This writing must strike all kinds of balances. Documentation must be thorough, accurate, and colloquial enough for people to understand it. Website copy needs to whet your information appetite <em>and</em> make you hungry to learn more," he remarked. And running the blog sometimes requires a rather fantastical use of the third-person to make it appear that—however impossible at a company with only one writer—someone else wrote this post about him.</p>
<p>"At least I know I'm the only guy here who can do what I do," he said to himself.</p>
<p>Brendan's work history includes other off-center things like that. "I was a teenage butcher," he said. "That is, I was a teenager who worked in a butcher shop. That's not that weird. What's weird is that I was a vegetarian. So, I was a teenage vegetarian butcher. I don't get it, either." During his freight-riding days, he worked for a temp agency in New York City. "One day this outfit sent me to Calvin Klein headquarters to fold sweaters for fashion journalists. I got paid more per hour for that than I do now. The previous week I'd spent two days in a ditch in Newark waiting for a boxcar with an open door."</p>
<p>After spending two years pursuing a B.A. in Film/Video Studies at Marlboro College, Brendan jettisoned those credits to start over at New Saint Andrews College. His senior thesis molted into a book about <em><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/10/Sagebrush.jpg">artemisia tridentata</a> </em>called <em><a href="http://www.brightrockpress.com/otherbooks.html">Rain from a Rainless Sky</a></em>—a title which makes him want to build a time machine so he can go back and change it. Nevertheless, it remains the bestselling work of theological botany in decades, and for exercise, he swims around in his cash royalties just like <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/10/scrooge-mcduck.jpg">Scrooge McDuck</a>.</p>
<p>Outside the office, Brendan is one of those guys you see taking pictures of <a href="http://onthathill.tumblr.com/post/9261880480/canary-grass">field grass at sunset</a> or <a href="http://onthathill.tumblr.com/post/6626505361/two-grain-elevators-at-the-bottom-of-washtucna">grain elevators</a>. To help him feel like it matters, he posts some of it on <a href="http://onthathill.tumblr.com/">the internet</a>, that cavernous space where self-expression encounters the void and dies. To succor his soul, he serves as a church deacon and makes his home outside of town <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/10/IMG_2877.jpg">with his wife Sharon and their three little people</a>—Flannery, Huckleberry, and Atticus. <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/10/ohogs.jpg">Two hogs</a>* grunt in the tall grass behind the house. Hens hide eggs in secret nests in the brush. Tomatoes grow in a compost-fueled jungle in their garden. Once a month the whole brood trundles out to another farm to handle slaughter duties at a free-range broiler operation. "I love food—enough that I had to start growing it myself. I suppose I could just retire from Populi, buy a farm with my book royalties, and become a gentleman farmer. But I love gold even more than I love food, and no one's touching my precious gold. No one. Nuh-uh," said Brendan to himself, out loud. His office mates eyed him nervously.</p>
<p>Gold fever and artsy pretensions notwithstanding, Brendan's pretty sure the Populi team is happy to have him around. For starters, none of those guys could draw a semicolon even with detailed instructions. And—their illiteracy aside—Brendan is happy as a pig in slop to be working with the Populi crew. "I go back quite a ways with some of the guys here, and of all the things we've done, now we're building a company together. It's a rare privilege to get to help build this with these people, to help establish its culture and tone, and to have my writing contribute to that edifice."</p>
