<h4>Plus, full LTI capability and other improvements</h4>
<p>New in Populi courses: live chat! Now your instructors and students can converse in real-time right in any Populi course. Chats let you embed images (even from Instagram), videos from YouTube and Vimeo, documents from <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2012/07/embed-documents-in-populi-with-scribd/">Scribd</a>, and even use <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2012/03/populi-now-has-emoji-support/">emoji</a> characters. They're easy to set up: just schedule one and everyone in the class—students, auditors, profs, teaching assistants—can join the conversation.</p>

<p>To use chat, the course instructor just needs to click Chat and start a new chat session. There's nothing to set up or figure out—it's live and ready to go in every Populi course.</p>

<h5>Populi now has full LTI capability</h5>
<p>A few months ago we added some basic LTI functionality, letting you link Populi courses to Moodle (or any other LTI-capable LMS). We beefed this feature up in two key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The LTI connection now lets the external LMS pass grades back through to Populi's gradebook</li>
<li>Faculty no longer need to remember the consumer key and shared secret to link to the external LMS</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about it in our <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/entries/22145137#LTI">Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
<h5>Here's some other stuff we released recently:</h5>
<p>The Data Slicer has a few new reporting options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now get data for Cumulative Credits across <em>All Terms</em> (which lets you get data out of Populi that was previously tedious to retrieve)</li>
<li>We also added <em>Unknown</em> and <em>Blank</em> to the Exit Reason options in the Data Slicer, as well as a new condition called Student Role Status, which has options for <em>Active</em> and <em>Inactive</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Degree Audit now shows incomplete courses in the "not completed" view.</p>
<p>Course evaluations have a new faculty visibility option: <em>Available after 60% completion and course is finalized.</em></p>
<p>You can now create custom course Delivery Methods in Academic Settings. We also let you use Delivery Method as a fee rule. And, you can now include Delivery Method in the XLS export of the Courses Table.</p>
<p>Custom transcripts can now include course comments and progam-based honors (contact support if you'd like us to update your transcript template).</p>
