<p>Here's an article from <strong>Info</strong><strong>world</strong> that outlines the <strong>top 5 reasons</strong> "<strong><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/applications/why-businesses-still-hate-enterprise-software-672?page=0,1&amp;source=rss_applications">Why  businesses still hate enterprise software</a></strong>". What are they? <strong>According to the Infoworld survey: </strong>High cost of ownership, difficult upgrades, poor cross-functional processes, unmet business requirements, and inflexibility. The article's links are worth following... if only to see <strong>what a nightmare giant, jargon-choked ERP software deployments</strong> can be.</p>
<p>This article brings to our minds <strong>37signals' advice to software providers that want to do things differently—</strong><a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Have_an_Enemy.php"><strong>have an enemy</strong></a>. If we have an enemy here at Populi, it's the academic version of the bloated ERP so castigated in the survey. Massive and labor-intensive—<strong>and way too expensive for small colleges</strong>—it gives us our <em>raison d'etre</em>. As we see it, <strong>our job is to keep our customers happy</strong> so you'll have better things to say about us than the Infoworld respondents did about their ERP's.</p>
