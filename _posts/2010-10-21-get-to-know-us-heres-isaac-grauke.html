<p>If Isaac enjoys one thing about being CEO, it's that he doesn't need to traffic in meaningless corporatized nonsense to talk about his job. Rather, he gets to speak English to real people. "While I do spend <em>some</em> time steering the company, I get to focus on what's really important—serving our customers," says Isaac. "I handle about 95% of live customer training, 80% of phone support, and 30% of web support. When I'm not handling support, I'm making video tutorials or interacting with our users in our online Forums. Basically, anything that makes <a href="http://populi.co/about/support"><strong>our support</strong></a> more efficient and meaningful to our customers while keeping up with the growth of the business. Just as long as we never have to turn them over to some godforsaken, outsourced call center.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," he adds, "that means you'll hear our toddlers playing in the background."</p>
<p>The toddlers in question are Isaac's three children, <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/10/odd.html">Gus</a> (five), <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/08/summertime-grace.html">Evie</a> (four), and <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/09/mr-potato-head.html">Max</a> (seven months). Sometimes he works from home, fielding calls and making videos, while their full-time wrangler <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/06/one-in-each-hand.html">Katie</a> (Isaac's wife of eight years) steps out to handle one of her <a href="http://www.graukeviolin.com/">violin students</a> or her chamber music group. Between work and the general energy required to go anywhere with the younguns, Isaac has to be diligent to carve out quality time. "I make it my mission on the weekends to do something unforgettable—whether it's a <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/09/labor-day-drive-to-top-of-moscow.html">family drive</a> up to the top of <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/09/from-top-of-moscow-mountain.html">Moscow Mountain</a>, or sitting out in a<a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/10/in-deer-blind.html"> deer blind with Gus and Evie</a>." The Grauke family also <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/09/home-grown.html">keeps a garden</a>, hauls <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/07/evie-reels-one-in.html">gigantic fishies</a> from the icy Idaho waters, remotely takes <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/08/trail-camera-best-from-week-two.html">stunning wildlife</a> <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/07/testing-my-trail-camera.html">photos</a>, and aspires to the day when Katie will have a proper place to exercise <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/05/sauteed-swiss-chard.html">her culinary gifts</a>. "We have plans to build a house next year and I swear we won't have any money left after my wife finishes her kitchen plan," laments the CEO. If the house plans don't work out, the Graukes have other options. Like going feral and living in their <a href="http://www.isaacgrauke.com/2010/07/spirit-of-wild.html">tipi</a>.</p>

<p>Isaac cut his software teeth helping his mother set up Quicken on their home computer in the mid-90's. After earning a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts at New Saint Andrews College in preparation for an MBA, he bypassed business school and moved right into the workforce. After a stint as a barista and a few years <a href="http://www.hallclosetuniforms.com/">marketing uniforms</a> to nurses and schoolchildren, he jumped aboard with <a href="http://www.economicmodeling.com/">EMSI</a>, where his business card soon read <em>VP of Customer Solutions and Consulting</em>. Among other things, he trained people in the use of EMSI's web-based economic data tools and became an expert on all sorts of <a href="http://www.economicmodeling.com/data/emsi-data-sources/">esoteric</a>, <a href="http://www.onetacademy.com/view.cfm?id=112&amp;info=1" target="_blank">cardboard-dull topics</a>. When EMSI started work on Populi, Isaac was drawn to work with the smaller team; when EMSI decided to spin off the college software into a separate company, Isaac found himself at the helm.</p>

<p>"The job of running Populi is mercifully light on the typical CEO stuff," says Isaac. "Everyone at Populi has a really good handle on where we want to go as a company, and how to get there. We're all really comfortable and capable in our roles. We're all 'managers of one'. If you've ever seen a wolf pack take down an elk, you'll notice they didn't need deadlines or employee reviews to do it."</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, Isaac. He runs Populi, runs his family, and... just runs. "Yeah, I do a good bit of running. Mostly shorter stuff like Spokane's 7.46 mile <a href="http://www.bloomsdayrun.org/">Bloomsday</a>, maybe sometimes a 13.1-mile half-marathon. I may try a full marathon someday, but my motto is '<strong>I don't train, I race</strong>'... so I'm not sure how that would go."</p>
