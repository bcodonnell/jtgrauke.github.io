<p>Elise Italiano at <a href="http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/">Public Discourse</a>, in her article <em><a href="http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2014/02/11789/">Community, Contemplation, and Computers: the Role of Technology in Education</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though it is becoming clear that technology is <em>changing</em> the way we learn, it is not yet clear that it is <em>improving</em> it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though concerned with recent developments in K-12 education (especially in light of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/06/what-connected">White House's ConnectED Initiative</a>), there's plenty here for higher-ed folks to contemplate regarding the relationship between pedagogy and technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>Those who embrace the White House’s view of education share three main presumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Education should be highly individualized;</li>
<li>Digital interaction with concepts and ideas is an effective and desirable means of learning;</li>
<li>Education should be primarily geared toward helping produce students with skills for the workplace.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We, obviously, are in the education technology business. We really think Populi can help small colleges. But as we've written before, there's a lot of hot air about online learning that has nothing to do with actually getting students a meaningful education.</p>
<p>The best presumption anyone can make about online learning is that it's an amplifier: both in the sense that amplifiers get your voice out to more people, and in that small pedagogical problems are more likely to become big ones.</p>
