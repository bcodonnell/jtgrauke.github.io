<p>We released Populi's <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/tour/courses">online learning</a> features <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/blog/2009/09/new-populi-release-enhanced-course-cloning-by-degree-transcripts-speed-increases-and/">last week</a>. Have a look at this <span style="font-weight: normal;">short video</span> to get an idea of what they can do. Hopefully the blog and the main website will become more video-rich in the upcoming weeks and months. It's one thing to writeabout what the system does, but it's really quite another to actually see how it works.</p>
