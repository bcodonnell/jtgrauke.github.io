<p>Our development guys put in a late night last night to push a number of updates live. This is a <strong>pretty far-reaching release,</strong> encompassing everything from <strong>minor interface-jiggering</strong> to substantial <strong>hardware updates.</strong> All in all, Populi is now <strong>more stable, quite a bit swifter, and more usable</strong> than it was the last time you logged in. We've got some of the higher-profile items listed after the jump, and a full list available for our users to read in our <strong>help system.</strong> Some of these updates trickled out over the past few weeks in response to customer needs, so maybe some of this is old news. Anyway, without further ado: <!--more--></p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/blog/2009/11/doing-business/"><strong>before</strong></a>, we've adopted a <strong><a href="http://populi.co/legal/privacy">Privacy Notice</a></strong>, <a href="http://populi.co/legal/copyright"><strong>Copyright Policy</strong></a>, and <a href="http://populi.co/legal/terms"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></a> which govern the day-to-day use of Populi.</p>
<p><strong>New servers: </strong>Our page hits have been doubling every month, and weâ€™ve been experiencing some growing pains. So we've obtained a new server cluster which considerably improves our speed and stability, while also affording us some much-needed room to grow. These upgrades included a brand-new, <strong>dedicated Email server.</strong> Email is a <strong>storage and performance hog,</strong> and putting it on its own server <strong>substantially streamlines</strong> the workload for our other servers. Email's a lot snappier, and so is Populi as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Unicode Support: </strong>Need to write an email in, say, <strong>Hebrew?</strong> Now you can. We've added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"><strong>UTF-8/Unicode support</strong></a> to Email (and throughout Populi, for that matter).</p>
<p><strong>We've beefed up course cloning</strong> so it better reflects and enables the kind of usage our customers need from this feature. <strong>Faculty</strong> can now clone courses right from the course instance page, with the ability to clone only specific items. Even bigger, <strong>Registrars</strong> can use the <strong>new Import Courses feature</strong> to clone some or all courses from one academic term to another. Populate an entire term with courses in a few clicks. You can even<strong> include course data</strong> (assignments, reading lists, etc. ... everything but faculty, students, and schedule) in the import.</p>
<p><strong>Export your Gradebook to Excel</strong>, and import a .CSV database/spreadsheet into your gradebook. This means you can, among other things, <strong>import Scantron test scores straight into Populi.</strong></p>
