<p>Every person in Populi gets <a href="http://populi.co/tour/people">their own profile</a>. It's the best way to gather, organize, and easily find information about the teeming mass of individuals involved with your school. Of course, one of the things about people is that we're all connected in webs of relationships—familial, professional, social—so we built a way for you to keep track of that, too. Fittingly enough, it's called... Relationships.</p>
<p>It's in the Info tab on everyone's profile, showing and linking to everyone in Populi that the person is related to in some way:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-relationships-panel.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2245" style="margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="1-23-12 relationships panel" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-relationships-panel.png" alt="" width="400" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>There are several types of relationships, and one click designates any one of them as the person's Emergency Contact:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-Edit-Relationships.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2246" style="margin-left: 78px; margin-right: 78px; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="1-23-12 Edit Relationships" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-Edit-Relationships.jpg" alt="" width="363" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>You can sync contact info among related people. This spares you having to double-enter addresses and the like:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-sync-address.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2244" style="margin-left: 140px; margin-right: 140px; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="1-23-12 sync address" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-sync-address.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="59" /></a></p>
<p>Relationships also facilitates some handy communications options, like spouse and merge options in mailing lists:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-Mailing-Lists.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2247" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="1-23-12 Mailing Lists" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-Mailing-Lists.png" alt="" width="510" height="78" /></a></p>
<p>Another cool thing— parents of students get "Parent of [standing]" system tags, letting you easily communicate with, say, Parents of Seniors to tell them about upcoming graduation activities:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-Tags.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2248" style="margin-left: 183px; margin-right: 183px; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="1-23-12 Tags" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/01/1-23-12-Tags.png" alt="" width="124" height="165" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Relationships: another simple feature that lets you do a lot with the people you're keeping up with in Populi.</strong></p>
