<p>This one didn't quite make it in with our <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/blog/2010/03/new-features-bookstore-and-credit-card-processing/"><strong>most recent release</strong></a>, but here it is now: we just released <strong>Attendance Reporting! </strong>Now you can view <strong>summaries of attendance stats</strong> for all your courses in a given term. Go to Academics, and under Term, click Attendance. Drawing on the attendance records taken in individual <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/tour/courses"><strong>courses</strong></a>, the table shows you each student and how many presents, tardies, absents, etc. they've accumulated that term.Â  <strong>Filter the table</strong> down to see students who fit particular criteria (over a certain number of absences, for instance), and export them to a spreadsheet or <strong>email them all with one click.</strong> We've found that a lot of schools needed this sort of tool, and we're pleased to get it out there to them.</p>
