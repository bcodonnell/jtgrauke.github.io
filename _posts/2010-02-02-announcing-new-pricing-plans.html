<p>Announcing our <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/pricing">new pricing plans</a>!</p>
<p>We're offering three "sizes": Small, Medium, and Large. Each plan gets you everything we offer: access for unlimited faculty, staff, and students; customer support; training; implementation—the whole works. They elaborate on our core pricing principles: to keep Populi affordable and keep the price transparent. So what's the difference? Just some of the math. We priced the plans so Populi would make even better fiscal sense for colleges in the 400-students-and-above range.</p>
<p>So, the specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small</strong>, which we recommend for colleges with fewer than 360 students, is $199 a month, plus $7 per student per month. This is basically our previous price minus $1 a month.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong>, which we recommend for colleges with between 360 and 840 students, is $499 a month, plus $6 per student per month.</li>
<li><strong>Large</strong>, which we recommend for colleges with more than 840 students, is $1199 a month, plus $5 per student per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>We based the plans—and our recommendations—on the annual cost for a college based on a typical school year: 10 months, give or take, of full enrollment, with two summer months of low or no enrollment. If you have 520 students, Medium makes the most sense; if you have 114 students, Small gets you the best deal... and so on. Picking a plan doesn't lock you in to anything long-term, and you're free to change it at any time.</p>
<p>If you're wondering which plan makes the most sense for your college, we'd be <a href="http://www.populiweb.com/contact">happy to talk</a> about it with you.</p>
