<p id="ctl00_pContentPlaceHolder_ctl05_MainHeading">Although <a href="http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2009/08/20/IT-on-Demand-The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Cloud-Computing-in-Higher-Education.aspx?Page=1">this <strong>Campus Technology</strong> article</a> has somewhat larger institutions in view, it's a pretty good summary of the benefits that web-based software like Populi brings to small colleges. The only thing "off-note" it strikes is the title: "IT on Demand: The Pros and Cons of Cloud Computing in Higher Education"â€”it doesn't really mention the cons (in part because, I would submit, cons are rather hard to come by) so much as it exhorts colleges to <strong>"Look at what's most important to your school and how technology will help you reach those goals."</strong></p>
<p><strong>By that metric, we've found that Populi is a great fit for small colleges</strong> and the different situations they find themselves in: pursuing accreditation, getting a better grip on their information, expanding their online education presence, reducing infrastructure costs... to say nothing of<strong> simply better serving their students, faculty, and staff.</strong></p>
