<p>New in Populi courses: Conferences! We've added an integration with <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org">BigBlueButton</a>, a web conferencing service designed for online learning. With Conferences, your faculty can offer live video streaming, presentations, a virtual whiteboard, chat, and live discussions right inside Populi courses. Here's how you can get your school started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your school gets a hosted version of BigBlueButton through <a href="https://blindsidenetworks.com">Blindside Networks</a>. Blindside provides BBB hosting and support services to schools around the world. (You can also set up your own hosting environment for BigBlueButton.)</li>
<li>You'll plug some API credentials from Blindside into Account &gt; Integrations.</li>
<li>Immediately, all of your courses will have the new Conferences view. Your faculty and students will be able to start using BBB right away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conferences will let you do even more with online courses in Populi. For more details, have a look at the <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002285254">Populi Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
