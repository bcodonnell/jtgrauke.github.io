<p>Our <strong><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/02/new-release-improves-search-degree-audits-relationships-and-statements/">last release</a></strong> (about a week ago) included a number of improvements to student financials that we incorporated after taking in some good feedback from our customers. True to form, our customers had a lot to say about the new statements, and we're releasing some improvements to our improvements tonight. It's all in an effort to make a tricky lump of information easier to understand—for your staff and your students.</p>
<h4>Here are the improvements we have slated for tonight's release:</h4>
<p>We collapsed Pending Charges and Invoiced Charges into one concise panel on Student &gt; Financial &gt; By Term:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/Charges.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2045" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 26px; margin-right: 26px;" title="Charges" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/Charges.png" alt="" width="458" height="138" /></a></p>
<p>Invoice pages are even more detailed<strong></strong>, now showing Pending Aid and a new invoice summary showing everything that affects the Amount Due:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/Invoice-Summary.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2040" style="margin-left: 66px; margin-right: 66px; border: 1px solid black;" title="Invoice Summary" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/Invoice-Summary.png" alt="" width="387" height="138" /></a></p>
<p>You can manually apply Pending Financial Aid to invoices before you disburse it; when you do disburse the Aid, it hits invoices according to your selections:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/apply-finaid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2041" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 78px; margin-right: 78px;" title="apply finaid" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/apply-finaid.png" alt="" width="353" height="428" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pending Aid now factors into the Amount Due shown on Student Financial &gt; Dashboard <em>and</em> By Term:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/AMOUNTS-DUE.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2042" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; border: 1px solid black;" title="AMOUNTS DUE" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/AMOUNTS-DUE.png" alt="" width="410" height="415" /></a><br />
The Unpaid Invoices export now includes a column with Pending Aid for each invoice:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/Unpaid-Invoices.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2043" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Unpaid Invoices" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/Unpaid-Invoices.png" alt="" width="510" height="37" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We added the ability to auto-apply Unapplied Payments &amp; Credits when you issue a new invoice (and a Yes/No setting to enable or disable this behavior):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/Default.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2044" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" title="Default" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/Default.png" alt="" width="470" height="79" /></a></p>
<p>The net effect of these updates is to mitigate the confusion caused by having differing Amounts Due for the same student—which we acknowledge has been a real headache for some of our customers. We've been looking for a good way to show what a student needs to pay your school given the wrinkles caused by Term-specific charges, Term-agnostic charges, pending Financial Aid, Payment Plans, and so on. And we think we've found it; we're certainly happier with this arrangement than we've been with our past handling of this information.</p>
<p>So now the Amounts Due that you see will be the same numbers your students see when they go to pay with a credit card (oh,  yeah, "Pay Now" will now also say "Amount Due" everywhere except when recording a payment). Here's an example:</p>
<p>You issue invoice #99 to Joe Adams in Fall 2010  for a $500 Auditor Fee, which he doesn't pay. You issue #100 to him in Spring 2011 for $1000 in tuition. He has a $500 scholarship pending in Spring, and you've put #100 on the "50/50" Payment Plan, which splits his invoice into two payments for 50% of the invoice—one due mid-term, the other due at the end of the term. Joe, who has a habit of parking his <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/03/monster.jpg">monster truck</a> in the Faculty parking lot, has also accrued $1000 in parking tickets—for which you've invoiced him on his Financial Dashboard (Inv. #101). Joe logs in mid-term to settle up what he owes you at that point and sees:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Fall By Term Amount Due of $500 from unpaid invoice #99</li>
<li>A Spring By Term Amount Due of $250 from unpaid invoice #100 ($1000 - $500 in pending aid - $250 to pay later)</li>
<li>A Dashboard Amount Due of $1750 (#99-$500 + #100-$250 + #101-$1000)</li>
<li>When he clicks to pay with his dad's credit card, his <strong>Pay Now</strong> says $1750 and he also sees he'll need to pay another $250 later</li>
</ul>
