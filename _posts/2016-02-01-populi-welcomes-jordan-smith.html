<p>Man, our <a href="http://populi.co/contact/">contact page</a> is going bananas. Emily Hoos came aboard in <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2015/10/populi-welcomes-emily-hoos/">October</a> to bring order (and an unreal beverage selection) to our office. And now, three months later, behold: Jordan Smith, our new support representative, who officially came aboard January 1st and made an appearance at our <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2015/12/merry-christmas-and-a-happy-2016-from-populi/">2015 Christmas party</a>. We've known Jordan for many years. Most of us worked with him back in the EMSI days, and he's <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2015/02/get-to-know-us-heres-joel-penney/">Joel Penney's</a> brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Jordan brings with him years of troubleshooting and technical support.Â As Help Desk Team Lead at EMSI, he kept everyone's laptops and Salesforce integrations in fighting trim; as owner-operator of Palouse PC, he did IT consulting for a variety of small businesses and institutions here in Moscow, Idaho. While still getting the hang of everything Populi does, he definitely knows what our customers need. He's already essential to handling support alongside Isaac and Josh.</p>
<p>A native of Amityville, Long Island, New York, (yup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amityville_Horror">that one</a>) Jordan is the husband of Kara and father to Isla. We're really happy to have him working with us!</p>
