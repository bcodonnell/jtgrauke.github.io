	I can&#8217;t say I recall what the plan for the coming year was twelve months ago, but it&#8217;s probably safe to say 2020 did not go according to it. Instead, we had the distinct honor of assisting a multitude of you excellent people doing what was necessary to continue educating your students in the face	of unexpected challenges. It&#8217;s been a privilege, and we want to thank you all for keeping us so busy this year.

	As always, from everyone here to all of you whoÂ made 2020 a great year to work at Populi, we wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

	P.S. More on this later, but in late 2019 we embarked on a project long dreamed of: a Populi headquarters built out specifically for us. We moved 
	in a couple days ago. Here&#8217;s a little video we made to document moving day.
