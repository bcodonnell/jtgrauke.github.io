	Amid growing concerns about COVID-19 many schools are moving, or considering moving, classes online. If your school is using Populi, you already have access to a full-fledged online learning management system (LMS), and we&#8217;re here to help you make that transition.
</p>
<p>
	To that end, next week we&#8217;ll be hosting an online webinar for administrators and faculty members who aren&#8217;t yet familiar with, or just want to brush up on Populi&#8217;s online learning features. You can <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044373994">sign up for that webinar here</a>.
