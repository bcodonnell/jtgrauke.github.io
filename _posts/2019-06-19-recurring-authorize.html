<p>You can now use Authorize.net payment gateways to take recurring payments and donations in Populi.</p>

<p>To get started, head to <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/223796007" target="_blank">Financial &gt; Settings &gt; Payment Gateways</a> in Populi. Point your <em>Tuition &amp; Fees</em> or <em>Donations</em> uses at it. Then make sure recurring payments are enabled in <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/223796327" target="_blank">Financial &gt; Settings &gt; General</a> or <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024769053" target="_blank">Donations &gt; Settings</a>. And that's it (on the Populi side, anyway; you may also need to jiggle a few settings in your Authorize.net merchant terminal).</p>

<p>After enabling recurring payments and donations, your online payment forms will give donors and payers the option to make this one-time or recurring monthly payment. Students can also choose a <a href="https://populi.co/blog/2018/12/big-improvements-for-payment-plans/">payment plan</a> and have the recurring payments follow the plan's schedule. To help you keep track of recurring payments, Billing and Donations both include <em>Recurring</em> reports that show you all the details, including amounts, timeframes, and payment methods. You can also manage a person's recurring payments on their Profile > Financial page or send them a link to take care of it themselves.</p>

<p>Stripe customers have had these features for years, and we're pleased to now be able to offer them to our Authorize.net users as well.</p>
