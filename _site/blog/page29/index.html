			<h5>...a tale told with bullet lists</h5>
<p>Simple as we think our <a href="http://www.populi.co/pricing">pricing</a> is, the college software industry seems to have primed our market to think that we've just <em>gotta</em> be hiding something... or lying. Some typical exchanges:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Us:</em> <strong>Populi has no upfront costs.</strong><br />
<em> College:</em> Okay, how much do you charge for implementation?</li>
<li><strong>Populi charges per active student.</strong><br />
What do you charge for alumni?</li>
<li><strong>We do not charge for software updates.</strong><br />
How much do you charge for new versions of the software?</li>
<li><strong>The entire program is included in the price.</strong><br />
What's the charge for extra modules?</li>
<li><strong>For one price, everyone at your school can use it.</strong><br />
How much for additional licenses?</li>
</ul>
<p>We get these questions because almost no one in this business makes their pricing clear or even public. Just look on any education software website and <em>try</em> to find a number—<em>any</em> number—indicating what it might cost. Most of them want you to trade a bunch of institutional information with them for a "free, customized quote". Our customers who've moved over from other systems (and prospects evaluating others alongside Populi) tell us that even these "customized" quotes are opaque and deliberately obfuscating. So when schools look at our pricing—which tells you what you get and what it costs—previous experience has trained them to read between the lines. This industry has made small schools cagey about just taking us at our word.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/es2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2149" title="es2" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/es2.png" alt="" width="488" height="158" /></a></p>
<p>So, we'd like to present to you a basic summary of what's covered on our Pricing page and in our <a href="http://populi.co/legal/terms#pricing">Terms of Service</a>. Here's what's in between the lines, as it were:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have three pricing plans (Small, Medium, and Large) aimed at different-sized institutions in the small college market.</li>
<li>Each plan includes a monthly Base Rate (which covers unlimited faculty, staff, and so on) and a per-student price.</li>
<li>By "student" we mean "active students". Active students are only those who were enrolled or auditing a course for more than seven calendar days in a given month.</li>
<li>We charge you this month for last month's active students. So, your September 1 bill includes your base rate and whatever active students you had in August.</li>
<li>The base rate and per-student price are all that we charge you (well, there's also a late fee if you don't pay your bill). Between them, they cover absolutely everything that we offer with Populi.*</li>
<li>That includes the software, support, infrastructure, implementation, maintenance, upgrades, and whatever else you can think of.</li>
<li>We integrate with some other services which might cost you money. We don't charge you—they do—we simply provide you with the integration tools.*</li>
<li>We <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> charge you to set up the system, train your users, provide support, maintain historical info, back up your data, add new features, store your alumni, let your students log in... and whatever else the other companies nickel and dime you for.</li>
<li>We just don't! We're not out to get you. We're not sneaking stuff in. We're not making stuff up.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, there's nothing between the lines.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how our pricing works:</p>
<p>In April, you have 100 enrolled students and auditors for the whole month. On May 6, your Summer Term begins and 90 students go home (25 of whom graduated and are now alumni). Ten students stick around for Summer Term to make sure they're caught up for Fall Term. You're on the "Small" pricing plan ($199 Base Rate, $7 per Active Student).</p>
<ul>
<li>Your May 1 invoice, which charges for April's students, comes to $899—$199 + ($7 x 100).</li>
<li>Your June 1 invoice, which charges for May's students, comes to $269—$199 + ($7 x 10). Not even a penny changes hands for those alumni.</li>
<li>In April, you have full access to everything Populi offers.</li>
<li>In May, you have full access to everything Populi offers.</li>
<li>For that matter, in June, you have full access to everything Populi offers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you might still have questions. We understand, and we're happy to tell you what you want to know—about our pricing, or just about anything else about Populi. We don't have anything to hide.</p>
<blockquote><p>* So you know, we're considering some "premium" options that'd cost extra. We, of course, promise to be clear and upfront about them, too... but there's nothing concrete to announce at this point.</p></blockquote>

		<h3 class="displayMedium"><a href="/blog/an-update-to-library-and-some-other-things" rel="bookmark" title="An update to Library and some other things">An update to Library and some other things</a></h3>
		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p>We loosed our latest release the evening of July 5th. It's a minor update with a number of tweaks and improvements to Library, ISIRs, and the Populi API.</p>
<h5>Library</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/Logsdon.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2145 alignright" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Logsdon" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/Logsdon.png" alt="" width="145" height="160" /></a><br />
Now you can add images to resources as well as delete resources or individual copies. Also included: automatic barcode generation for resource copies. This feature finds the next available barcode number and adds it to the copy—so it works around your existing resource copies without you needing to double-check (you can also disable the barcode generator).</p>
<p>To enhance Populi Library's cataloging abilities, we also built in a <strong>Z39.50</strong> search. Now when you add a resource, Populi Library fetches an image from Amazon.com and other resource data from a number of public Z39.50 servers. You can specify which servers you want it to search, add new ones, and even change the order Populi will search through.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/Waive-Fee.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2147" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Waive Fee" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/Waive-Fee.png" alt="" width="510" height="104" /></a>We also gave you the ability to waive a Library fine!</p>
<h5>API</h5>
<p>Our biggest update ever to the Populi API really beefs it up. Now you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new people and check for duplicates</li>
<li>Add and remove roles, tags, contact info, and custom info fields for anyone in the system</li>
<li>Add and retrieve Prospect information</li>
<li>Retrieve information about recently updated people</li>
<li>Request and download backup copies of your Populi data</li>
</ul>
<p>With the new API functions, you'll be able to add people, sync your Populi people with an external directory service, and send your Populi backups to external web applications to save and encrypt however you like. It also paves the way for us to do some other interesting things down the road...</p>
<h5>Miscellany</h5>
<p>We added CPS transaction numbers to ISIRs. This information lets the Populi ISIRs importer keep your data in better order. For instance, they prevent you from importing older data. We also organized the display of ISIRs data in various places by the CPS transaction number. This accompanies a number of other, more behind-the-scenes ISIRs improvements.</p>
<p>Additionally, this update is accompanied by some interface niggles and a number of bug fixes, tweaks, arcane performance changes, and so on.</p>

		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p>We <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/05/thoughts-on-outsourcing-it-to-us-vs-going-in-house/">recently posited</a> that it makes a lot of sense for small schools to outsource IT-intensive assets like their information systems. We think so not just because our service lets you do that, but because it really does save a small college a lot of time, money, and software migraines. And besides, colleges exist to educate, not build software. Small organizations—colleges and software companies, for instance—should stick to their core competencies. It's a key part of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_Embrace_Constraints.php">embracing constraints</a>.</p>
<p>At Populi, our core competency is providing college management software as a service. We do one thing (though, that one thing does a lot of different things), and it would be foolish to spread ourselves thin designing other software or maintaining other services.</p>
<p>We know this firsthand. Back in <a href="http://populi.co/about/">the emsi days</a>, a programmer built the first version of the Populi help system. It consisted simply of a custom search that scanned a hand-coded, wiki-style knowledge base.</p>
<p>This  worked <em>okay</em>... for a little while. The search did only one thing—it searched—and it still required our maintenance. And writing in a wiki knowledge base was about as much fun as getting caned with a bamboo rod.</p>
<p>More importantly, when Populi got going as  an independent company, we knew a lot more about our  customer support needs. We needed not just a searchable knowledge base, but also a way to efficiently channel support requests, embed training videos, get support metrics—and make support comprehensible to our users.</p>
<p>Now, we could have devoted one of our developers to expanding our custom search to do these other tasks. But that would have been to the considerable detriment of Populi itself. So, jettisoning the custom approach, we signed up with <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>. While  Zendesk <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/pricing">costs money</a>—money we watch go out the door every month—those are dollars well-spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't have to divert people, time, and money away from Populi to build a support system.</li>
<li>Zendesk has a great API, so it integrates seamlessly with Populi—better, even, than our in-house custom search did.</li>
<li>Our customers get access to a great support tool—we believe Zendesk <em>enhances</em> the service we offer and helps us make good on some of our <a href="http://populi.co/about/support">core company values</a>.</li>
<li>Zendesk provides updates and support for their software, helping us improve what we offer our customers with zero effort on our part.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also outsourced* our project management and related tasks to the folks at <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>, our accounting to <a href="http://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>, and our email to <a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/edu/index.html">Google Apps</a>. While none of these are customer-facing like Zendesk, they nevertheless help Populi run a lot more smoothly, which frees us up to do what we need to do. It's safe to say that we pretty much <a href="http://productblog.37signals.com/products/2010/03/populi-campfire-has-all-but-replaced-the-replyall-email-noise-that-used-to-plague-the-office.html">can't live without them</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, we find ourselves going in-house after using other software. For instance, we once used <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks</a> for invoicing, but now we route our customers to our in-Populi payment system. Now, Freshbooks is a great product,** and it really fit the bill for a time. But the same things that drove us to outsource other things—reduced cost and a better experience for our customers—drove us, in this case, to roll our own:</p>
<ul>
<li>We were asking our customers to use Populi for their work, to view an  invoice in Freshbooks, and make payment by yet some other means. This  needed streamlining.</li>
<li>We couldn't offer automatic payments—something that's expected of web-based software.</li>
<li>We spent too much time manually creating invoices and troubleshooting problems; our new system cuts down on that, for instance, by showing you which students you were charged for.</li>
<li>There was too much room for manual error; for instance, we had to re-enter  invoice amounts into our online banking every month in order to do ACH drafts.</li>
<li>The guts of the system were already there when we added online payments. It didn't take a lot of work to turn that into our own invoicing-and-payment system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This post is subtitled, "Sticking to what you're good at"—both our use of Zendesk and our move away from Freshbooks were both done with this in mind. Zendesk makes Populi better by making it super-simple for our customers to get support. Scooting in-house for invoicing helped us simplify our customers' bill-paying experience, and gave us another opportunity to improve what we do.</p>
<p>In other words, we certainly don't preach outsourcing for outsourcing's sake. Outsource when it makes sense to—and, as we've already said, we think it makes sense for small schools to outsource their information systems (to us, hopefully!).</p>
<blockquote><p>* Lemme just get this out of the way: when we say "outsourcing", we hope you know that we'll NEVER outsource development or support. Put another way, never outsource your core competencies!</p>
<p>** Our own <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/05/get-to-know-us-heres-mark-ackerman/">Mark Ackerman</a> says that Freshbooks "is nearly flawless."</p></blockquote>

		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p>Google <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2011/06/our-plans-to-support-modern-browsers.html">recently announced</a> that they'll be dropping Google Apps support for older browsers on August 1:</p>
<blockquote><p>As of August 1st, we will <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=37560">discontinue support</a> for the following browsers and their predecessors: Firefox 3.5,  Internet Explorer 7, and Safari 3.  In these older browsers you may have  trouble using certain features in Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Talk,  Google Docs and Google Sites, and eventually these apps may stop working  entirely.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there's one thing we always jump up and down about, it's that you should keep your browser updated. Browser updates improve security and functionality, and as more and more of our work moves to the web, this is more and more of a crucial issue. You could say we're pleased with Google's decision in this area because of the incremental improvement it may help bring to the web as a whole.</p>
<p>So, if you're using Google Apps for Education (with which we integrate, in case you didn't know), you'll need to make sure you're running an up-to-date version of a supported browser on August 1. That's about seven weeks away! To give you a leg up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Download Safari<br />
</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Download Chrome<br />
</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Download Firefox</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(Since we're giving you a leg up, we're not providing a link to download Internet Explorer... though we do support IE8 and IE9)</p>

		<h3 class="displayMedium"><a href="/blog/our-new-financial-aid-features" rel="bookmark" title="Our new Financial Aid features">Our new Financial Aid features</a></h3>
		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p>In the wee hours of Wednesday, June 8, we released our overhaul of Populi Financial Aid into the wild after months of development, testing, and refinement. The new features (together with the U.S. Department of Ed's proprietary <em>EdExpress</em> software) will let your Financial Aid office handle the entire aid process—everything from importing ISIRs to managing aid applications to batch disbursement of funds. We <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/05/financial-aid-the-movie/">previewed</a> the new stuff in some <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/05/coming-soon-a-refresh-for-populi-financial-aid/">recent</a> posts; here's a summary of what we just released:<br />
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/06/Tabs-6-8-11.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2121" title="Tabs 6-8-11" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/06/Tabs-6-8-11.png" alt="" width="510" height="39" /></a></p>
<h5>Navigation overhaul</h5>
<p>All of Populi Financial has been moved over to the new tab-based layout, which clarifies the navigation (and works better on mobile devices).</p>
<h5>Aid applications</h5>
<p>We built out aid applications so your aid office can track FAFSA data for each applicant, attach files to applications, and interact with student applicants from the application or via email. Students can upload files, ask questions, and accept or decline awards.</p>
<h5>ISIRs imports</h5>
<p>The new ISIRs importer converts the gobbledygook text file into all kinds of useful information for your school. FAFSA data automatically creates aid applications. Updated files plug new data right into existing apps. You can even create new Prospects if you receive an ISIRs file for someone you haven't heard of before.</p>
<h5>New workflows and reports</h5>
<p>Use Populi Financial Aid to track Federal Work Study awards. Create batch disbursements and aid refunds. Automate your disbursement schedules for the entire aid year. A new academic progress report lets you find students in trouble. Existing reports have been combined and redesigned to give you a wider, more comprehensive look at your school's Financial Aid data.</p>
<h5>Other stuff</h5>
<p>As usual, we took the opportunity to work in some bugfixes and performance improvements. We've made some architecture changes that will enable us to do a lot of cool things with future development.</p>
<p>And Financial Aid now has its own forum in the Populi help desk.</p>

		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p>As we're wont to say here, <a href="http://populiweb.com/about/">we built Populi</a> to put good software within reach of small colleges. We do that, in part, by giving them access to high-octane technology, otherwise out of reach to most schools, but made affordable by the wonders of economies of scale. This lets our customers offload much of their IT burden—infrastructure, processes, and maintenance—to us. Of course, there's more. Gliding atop those servers and databases and terabytes of storage is some elegant, easy-to-use, ever-improving software that helps a small school do more with its data. And, there's yet another layer: the people who use Populi have access to the people who run Populi. Need help with something? Wanna know how something works? Did something break? Support is always near at hand.</p>
<p>That, in a paragraph, is what's for sale here: high-end <a href="http://populi.co/about/webbasedhosted">technology</a>, excellent <a href="http://populi.co/tour/">software</a>, and <a href="http://populi.co/about/support">people</a> to back you up. And if it doesn't work for you, <a href="http://populi.co/legal/terms/">there's no</a> long-term contract forcing you to continue.</p>
<p>Every now and then, we lose a sale not to an established competitor, but to a school's in-house IT staff. Now, don't get us wrong—if Populi doesn't fit, don't try to wear it (to abuse the old proverb). If a school needs something different than Populi, we're the last ones who'll try to talk you into signing up. But the decision, from what we've heard, usually has little to do with service or functionality. A lot of times when a school says, "We're gonna build it ourselves..." the next line is usually something like, "...because we wanna keep expenses down."<strong>*</strong></p>
<p>Now, on the surface, this might make some sense. Your 400-student college didn't get that way without some sort of IT staff and technology investment. And if IT is already baked-in to your institution, then you already have a lot of what you need covered. A little extra development time, judicious use of free open-source technology, a stopgap Access database in the meantime...</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be done. But what will you end up with? Going by our experience, here's the <em>bare minimum</em> of what you'd need to build something <em>comparable</em> to Populi:</p>
<ol>
<li>A team of ten to twelve full-time employees.</li>
<li>Ultra-conservatively, about a million bucks.</li>
<li>Four years of continuous design, development, implementation, and refinement.</li>
<li>A roadmap for the next several years of the same.</li>
<li>Dedicated support staff, including a full-time writer to manage documentation (we'll assume you won't need to maintain a blog or a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/populi">Twitter feed</a>).</li>
<li>A well thought-out approach to user interaction design.</li>
<li>Top-end, <a href="/about/security">incredibly secure</a> servers, data centers, backups, file storage, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's some of what you'd need to make the month-to-month cost comparable:</p>
<ol>
<li>No dedicated staff on your payroll (but wait... what about point #2, above?).</li>
<li>Server and infrastructure costs shared among 90+ other colleges.</li>
<li>The ability to deal with problems quickly so your operations don't grind to a halt.</li>
<li>Nimble, proactive security protocols to ward off information thieves.</li>
<li><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/02/customer-support-never-say-never/">Justin Bieber haircuts</a> for your staff.<strong>**</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let's put this in stark economic terms. Say you take a look at what Populi <a href="http://populi.co/pricing/">would cost</a> your 400-student college over a five-year period:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the 9-month academic year, you're sending us $2,899 a month (under the Medium pricing plan)</li>
<li>During the 3-month Winter and/or Summer downtime, you opt for Small, and send us $199 a month.</li>
<li>So, for the year, $26,688. Over five years, you've parted with $133,440, give or take.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, over five years, you've spent on Populi what you'd spend on—let's assume your saintly staff works for peanuts—three annual IT salaries. All you need now is another seven people, items 2-7 from the first list and 1-5 from the second list. And someone to take over what your three IT guys were doing before you pulled the trigger on a new, in-house system.</p>
<p>So, yeah: we built Populi to put good software within reach of small colleges... because the service we offer—taken as a whole—is generally out-of-reach by other means.</p>
<p><strong>Post script:</strong> Read about our own approach to outsourcing software <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/06/our-own-approach-to-outsourcing-software-or-sticking-to-what-youre-good-at/">here</a>. To summarize, don't outsource just to outsource—make it part of your strategy to focus on your core competencies.</p>
<blockquote><p>*The decision to build in-house sometimes comes down to finances, but often also hinges on a perceived need for a different kind of feature or a different way of handling a certain workflow. We'll look at that in another blog post.</p>
<p>**Isaac and Toby like to get their hair cut <em>every three days!</em> It's a good thing that expense is spread out over 90-something customers.</p></blockquote>
