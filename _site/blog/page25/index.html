		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p>Every field bears thorns and thistles. A good farmer makes sure that they don't proliferate and ruin the crop. For that matter, every profession has its own thistles, its own bunch of ankle-biting thorns lurking in the wheat and the corn. For us here at Populi, those are software bugs, errors in the code we've written that cause functional problems for our users. So an important part of our job here is finding them and killing them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/H96566k.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/H96566k.jpg" width="510" height="402" /></a></p>
<p>Software bugs get their name from the days of computing yore* when a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UNIVAC-1103-BRL61-0905.jpg">modest computer</a> filled a room with hardware—lockers, tubes, relays, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/still-image/eckert/portrait_of_John_Mauchly.c1950s.102657887.lg.jpg">engineers</a>, switches—that moved information from Point A to Point B. "Bugs" in the system were just that: little creatures that got in the works and prevented the physical passage of electrical impulses from one locker or tube to another, thereby preventing the computer from working properly. Troubleshooting those problems had to be, I dunno, just a <em>ton</em> of fun.</p>
<p>Having built Populi without using lockers, tubes, and the like, our extermination system is much less arduous. We start with software testing, or, as it's called in the biz, "Quality Assurance". When our developers deploy code in our local development environment, it's kicked over to our QA crew—<a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/11/get-to-know-us-heres-toby-robinson/">Toby</a> and (more informally) <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/10/get-to-know-us-heres-brendan-odonnell/">Brendan</a> and <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/10/get-to-know-us-heres-isaac-grauke/">Isaac</a>. These three run the new feature or function through its paces to determine a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it work as intended?</li>
<li>Does it even work in the first place?</li>
<li>Does it break anything else?</li>
</ul>
<p>We ask other questions during the QA process,** but these three are key. If the QA guys find that the code or feature fails on one of these points, they send it back to the developer who authored it and tell them where to spray for pests. The respective teams repeat this process until the code or feature works. Only then do we release it.</p>
<p>Once we release, our users subject our code to a different kind of testing—that of everyday use in a live environment with all of its attendant surprises and unexpected side-roads. And if something's not working, they let us know.</p>
<p>The first thing we do in our bug hunt is verify whether there's a bug at all. Sometimes the user's workflow has gotten something out of order. Sometimes another user has changed or deleted something the first user was looking for. And sometimes we discover that everything's working fine, but we don't currently accommodate a particular "edge case" that the user needs Populi to handle. If it's the first problem a little garden-variety training is in order; if the second, we update the feature to handle the "edge case".</p>
<p>But if the user's problem turns out to be neither of the above, it's time to start digging through the code to see what grubs and creepy-crawlies we discover.</p>
<p>The digging is the part that's most like the old days of checking each switch, tube, and locker for moths. One of our programmers—usually <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/get-to-know-us-heres-patrick-swanson/">Patrick</a>—simply reads through the code, line-by-line, to find what's wrong. A few things to keep in mind about this job:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers and software are very literal; they require extremely precise instructions in order to work.</li>
<li>Bugs take several forms. The code might have a syntax problem, or is missing a statement, or has a slash where it should have a bracket (among a zillion other things).</li>
<li>Indeed, bugs are usually miniscule, but a tiny error is all it takes to transform a precise instruction into nonsense.***</li>
<li>Every part of Populi talks to other parts of Populi. And even those functions that aren't directly connected are linked together like that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_kevin_bacon">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>**** game from the late '90's. A bug in one place can affect a dozen other functions that rely on the broken function to do their own jobs.</li>
<li>Populi has about 361,000 lines of code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, knowing the nature of the problem narrows the needle-in-a-haystack odds in the bug hunt. For instance, if someone's having trouble in Admissions, we know not to look at the Library codebase. Of course, given Populi's intra-connectivity, sometimes we do need to look afield for the bug; a problem with Student Billing might trace back to an error in course enrollment, for example.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, a review of the code turns up one or more culprits, at which point we take the next steps—polishing the code, running it through our QA battery, and then finally releasing it to our live servers.<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-11-12-Bugs.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2286" title="3-11-12 Bugs" alt="via http://ibc.lynxeds.com/photo/bearded-tachuri-polystictus-pectoralis/pampa-tiny-eating-female-giving-moth-one-their-three-ch" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-11-12-Bugs.png" width="510" height="285" /></a></p>
<p>Fixing bugs can be very time-consuming, but we're laser-focused on it. We know that the only thing worse than us having to find a bug is having a bug prevent you from getting your work done. For us, bug-killing isn't an abstract matter of "we'll-get-to-that-someday" software development. It's a matter of active, responsive, "get-it-done-yesterday" customer support.</p>
<blockquote><p>*Yeah, I know, this is over-simplified.</p>
<p>**Especially the question: does it work in Internet Explorer? That browser is a real turkey sometimes.</p>
<p>***We recently found an error that consisted of one wrong character. Easiest fix ever!</p>
<p>****Isaac Grauke once met Kevin Bacon; therefore, there is only one degree of separation between any given Populi feature and the man himself.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p style="text-align: left;">We're pleased to release one of our customers' most-requested features: SMS Notifications! <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-8-12-iPhone.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2280" style="margin-left: 175px; margin-right: 175px;" title="3-8-12 iPhone" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-8-12-iPhone.png" alt="" width="160" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>It's really simple:</p>
<p>First, your users opt-in to receive emergency notifications via SMS in their personal settings. Once they've submitted their verification code, they can now receive SMS messages from you via Populi.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-8-12-SETTINGS.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2279" title="3-8-12 SETTINGS" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-8-12-SETTINGS.png" alt="" width="510" height="138" /></a></p>
<p>All you need to do is go to the new Emergency Notifications tab in Communications. Compose a message, hit send, and it'll go out to all of your active faculty, staff, students, and advisors who've opted-in (you can also select specific campuses). If any of the recipients haven't opted-in to receive SMS messages, they'll get an email instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-8-12-SMS-text-area.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2281" title="3-8-12 SMS text area" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-8-12-SMS-text-area.png" alt="" width="510" height="189" /></a></p>
<p>To help ensure your recipients can continue to get emergency notifications, we lock in their SMS number on their profile so it can't be changed by anyone, not even Staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-8-12-SMS-number.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2282" style="margin-left: 131px; margin-right: 131px;" title="3-8-12 SMS number" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/03/3-8-12-SMS-number.png" alt="" width="248" height="45" /></a></p>
<p>Each of our three <a href="http://populi.co/pricing/">Pricing Plans</a> comes with a certain number of SMS messages included for free. Small gets 500, Medium gets 1,000, and Large gets 2,000. If you run over your free allotment, additional SMS are just two cents per SMS recipient.</p>

			<p>The Populi crew took the evening of President's Day to release a bunch of new features. Here's a look at what we did...</p>
<h5><strong>New stuff in organizations</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-20-12-Org-Profile.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2272" title="2-20-12 Org Profile" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-20-12-Org-Profile.png" alt="" width="510" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>Organizations now have an Activity Feed; a Members tab to track members, employees, and students with that contact Org; custom info fields, and images.</p>
<h5><strong>Email</strong></h5>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/36933480?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="510" height="319" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Email dropboxing is a new feature that lets you post email to a person's Activity Feed from any email client. Check out the video to learn more about how it works.</p>
<p>We also now provide bounce/spam reports for email addresses on Profiles.</p>
<h5>Personal settings<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-20-12-Settings.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2273" style="margin-left: 107px; margin-right: 107px;" title="2-20-12 Settings" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-20-12-Settings.png" alt="" width="396" height="271" /></a></h5>
<p>New personal settings let you select your local timezone, hide your profile from non-staff users, keep your birthday off the News Feed, as well as let you choose a default Activity Feed visibility setting and generate your email dropbox. We also moved your email signature here.</p>
<h5>Library</h5>
<p>Library got some new reports and workflows, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource batches and Inventory in the Catalog</li>
<li>Circulation reporting by loan, resource, resource type, home library, and home location</li>
<li>Browse resources is now exportable</li>
</ul>
<h5>Financial</h5>
<p>A few new financial items:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now bulk-add tuition schedules from the Data Slicer</li>
<li>Invoice and transaction numbers are now generated sequentially (previously they were generated every-other-number to avoid potential conflicts)</li>
<li>You can now print financial aid award letters</li>
<li>We loosened the financial aid workflow: you no longer need to package aid before invoicing charges to have the aid auto-apply to those charges</li>
<li>Overaward alerts now exclude declined financial aid</li>
<li>More detailed totals under Profile &gt; Financial Aid &gt; Summary &gt; Total Aid</li>
<li>A new setting lets you select the Term you wish to begin automatically generating pending charges—this will be really helpful for schools that want to back-enter financial and billing data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />

			<p>The Populi development team is plugging away at our next release. Here's a glance at some of it:</p>
<h5>Personal settings for all users</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-01-at-1.30.07-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2257" style="margin-left: 117px; margin-right: 117px;" title="Screen shot 2012-02-01 at 1.30.07 PM" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/Screen-shot-2012-02-01-at-1.30.07-PM.png" alt="" width="275" height="22" /></a></p>
<p>Depending on your user roles, you'll have different options—Timezone, birthday announcement opt-out, Activity Feed visibility, plus a few other things.</p>
<h5>Organization profiles</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-1-12OrgMembers.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2258" title="2-1-12OrgMembers" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-1-12OrgMembers.png" alt="" width="510" height="271" /></a><br />
Organization Profiles are getting the look and functionality of regular Profiles. In addition to an Activity Feed, there'll also be a Members tab that lets you keep track of people in your system who are associated with that organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-15-12-Add-Org.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2270" style="margin-left: 28px; margin-right: 28px;" title="2-15-12 Add Org" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-15-12-Add-Org.png" alt="" width="454" height="260" /></a><br />
Associating people with Organizations will be easier—add new Orgs right from a person's Info tab. You can also specify the relationship (Employment, Member, and for <em>College</em> type orgs, Student) and the timeframe of the person's involvement with the Org.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also: custom info fields for Organizations!</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">New reports and workflows in Library</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-15-12-Circulation-reporting.png"><img class=" wp-image-2271 alignleft" title="2-15-12 Circulation reporting" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2012/02/2-15-12-Circulation-reporting.png" alt="" width="510" height="163" /></a></p>
<p>We'll be releasing a Circulation report with multiple perspectives on your active loans. In addition, there will be Inventory and Resource Batching tools in the Library Catalog.</p>
<h5>Email dropboxing</h5>
<p>The other marquee feature is email dropboxing. Dropboxing works by giving you a secret email address. When you copy or forward to that secret address, Populi will figure out the recipients and post your email to their Activity Feeds. The best part is, you can do this from <em>any</em> email client—Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, iOS Mail app, etc.—not just Populi. This will make your communications easier than ever to record, and will make the Activity Feed a more complete record of your correspondence with prospects, students, and other contacts.</p>

			<p>Say your small college is a family of five, you're shopping for a car, and you're wondering what's out there. Here's are some of your options:</p>
<h5>On the low-cost end you find:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The Word and Excel approach. This is like tying two bicycles together and calling it a car. It's cheap, it rolls, and you're gonna lose your groceries if you try pedaling home on that thing.</li>
<li>The roll-your-own Access-based system. This is a bicycle tied to a wheelbarrow, or perhaps a Flintstones-style, foot-powered car: either way, there's lots of hard work involved to make it go anywhere.</li>
<li>The K-12 program wedged into a higher education context. This is a riding lawn mower used as family transportation.</li>
<li>The fly-by-night company that barfs out something software-ish. This is the shifty used-car salesman pushing a beater '85 Plymouth with no muffler and the stuffing pulled out of the back seats. Also, it's on fire.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Then there are the big guys:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The giant hosted database with no interface. This is a 48' shipping container. I guess your family could just watch it sit there.</li>
<li>The LMS with all the bells and whistles. This is the luxury tour bus with the helipad and built-in swimming pool that gets two miles a gallon on the highway because it's too expensive to give it an oil change.</li>
<li>The open-source LMS. This is a school bus built out of parts from other vehicles and painted up to look like the luxury tour bus. Slightly better gas mileage on downhill slopes, though.</li>
<li>The huge, endlessly-customizable SIS with a three-year implementation period. This looks like you've ordered a custom-built Ferrari but by the time all the parts get bolted together you've ended up with a surplus U.S. Army transport.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, you'll need a team of mechanics to make sure your fleet of vehicles fits together. You'll also need a warehouse full of spare parts and some long-term maintenance contracts. Oh, and for some reason the window glass on the bus is all blacked-out—so you'll need to hire a third-party automotive glazier to design you a clear windshield.</p>
<h5>Is that it?</h5>
<p>Is that all that's available to a small college? Of course not. This is the Populi blog, and so now we're gonna liken Populi to the perfect family car... ready? Here goes:</p>
<p>Then there's Populi. This is the Toyota minivan, which seats five to seven, has a <a href="http://populi.co/about/support">lifetime parts-and-labor warranty</a>, and even has a built-in <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/file-storage-and-streaming-media/">DVD player</a> (if that's your thing) and <a href="http://populi.co/tour/bookstore">magazine</a> <a href="http://populi.co/tour/library">rack</a>. Sure, it's nothing flashy, but it's good, dependable transportation just right for a <a href="http://populi.co/pricing/">wide variety of families</a>.    </p>
