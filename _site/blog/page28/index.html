			<p>As September eclipsed August, the Populi crew stayed up into the wee hours pushing our new course and files features out into the wild. We've <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/big-files-better-assignments-new-question-types/">previewed</a> our new features in a few <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/a-video-preview-of-our-upcoming-improvements-to-courses/">recent</a> blog posts; here's a more complete description of what's new in Populi this morning...</p>
<h5>Courses</h5>
<p>We moved course instances over to our new tabbed layout, improving the look and organization of Populi courses.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/08/Nav.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2173" title="Nav" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/08/Nav.png" alt="" width="510" height="22" /></a></p>
<p>Tabs include Dashboard, Info, Assignments, Lessons, Discussions, Tests, Calendar, Roster, Gradebook, Attendance, and Reporting.</p>
<p>The new Course Dashboard features Course Alerts, a revamped Bulletin Board, a Schedule of upcoming course events, and updates to your Discussions.</p>
<p>Assignments now come in three flavors: Grade-only (just a grade, nuthin' more), Test (creates an online test), and File (lets teacher and student interact and revise a file, document, etc.).</p>
<p>Lessons now let you incorporate streaming media right from the lesson content thanks to our new files setup.</p>
<p>Discussions can now be course-wide or pinned to particular Lessons.</p>
<p>Tests feature two new question types: True/False and Matching. They're also created via "test" type assignments.</p>
<p>The course Calendar is now a tab right on the course page and feeds upcoming events into the course Dashboard.</p>
<p>Reporting features the Performance Dashboard and an enhanced Change Log.</p>
<h5>Files</h5>
<p><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/08/file-storage-and-streaming-media/">Free file storage</a>—including hosting, bandwidth, and streaming—included with every pricing plan, with extra storage available for $2.50 per GB per month.</p>
<p>Increased file upload sizes throughout Populi for all your users.</p>
<p>New large file uploader lets faculty and Admins upload files up to 2 GB in size.</p>
<p>Video files automatically encoded into multiple formats optimized for playback on multiple kinds of devices.</p>
<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
<p>We updated the Populi API to allow Single Sign-on from your own custom web services.</p>
<p>Via the API, you can also pass information into Populi via your own customized inquiry form.</p>
<p>ISIR importer now orders imported ISIRS based on Processed Date.</p>
<p>Plus the usual plethora of minor visual tweaks, bugfixes, and performance optimizations.</p>

			<p>Back when we released our <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/06/our-new-financial-aid-features/">update</a> to Populi Financial Aid, we also changed how Populi handles files. It's been a low-key update thus far, but our new files setup opens up a ton of new possibilities for our customers—including hosting and streaming video right from Lessons and Tests in your Populi courses. We're also updating our <a href="http://www.populi.co/pricing">pricing plans</a>: each one will include a generous chunk of free file storage with the option to add more as you need it.</p>
<h5>The old way and the new way</h5>
<p>Files include everything from your personal document storage to the syllabi you upload to courses to your profile pictures. Previously, your files lived on our own servers, but this proved too limiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had to limit the size and quantity of files our customers could upload.</li>
<li>You could only upload or download files. If you wanted to stream, say, an MP3 or video, you just couldn't—even if it were small enough to upload in the first place!</li>
<li>We didn't have the resources to make our files setup accommodate where we want to take Populi.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kind of file hosting we've been wanting for Populi is two things: A) surprisingly complicated and B) not one of our <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/06/our-own-approach-to-outsourcing-software-or-sticking-to-what-youre-good-at/">core competencies</a>. It's surprisingly complicated, for instance, to enable media streaming that plays on enough devices—PCs, Macs, iPads, Android phones, etc.— to make it at all useful. If you want to do anything more than store and serve files, you're getting into outlandish territory for a college software company—our specialties are software and support.</p>
<p>So we took up with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services's</a> S3 cloud storage. AWS gives us access to Amazon's cavernous servers, economies of scale, global reach, and some excellent tools we didn't want to spend years developing ourselves (more on that in a minute). We also reconfigured our backups to make use of <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace's cloud hosting services</a>. Amazon and Rackspace are two of the top cloud service providers, with better than 99.99% uptime and reliability. When it comes to files in Populi, we're more than happy to hitch up to those wagons.</p>
<p>So now, when you look up a student, Populi makes a few calls to Amazon and retrieves their profile picture, files stored in their Activity Feed, documents attached to their application's custom fields, and so on. When you upload a document to a course, it lodges on Amazon's servers and a backup copy takes up residence at Rackspace. It's a great, reliable setup that capitalizes on the expertise, tools, and infrastructure of two of the industry's best cloud storage services.</p>
<p>But that's all on the back end, and from what our customers can tell after two months, nothing much has changed at all...</p>
<h5>Here's what's coming soon: Bigger file uploads and media streaming</h5>
<p>Alongside our <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/07/coming-soon-new-stuff-for-course-instances/">upcoming refresh of course instances</a>, we're going to unlock even more of what our new files setup can do for our customers. Gone is our old 32 MB limit—we're upping it to 2 GB*. Effectively, this now makes Populi a viable option for hosting video and audio files, which can be pretty gigantic.</p>
<p>But what's more, we're also taking advantage of Amazon's <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a> Content Delivery Network, which will enable embedded media streaming right from your Populi courses. Here's how it works: When you upload a video lecture, it goes to Amazon's S3 cloud servers (and gets backed up to Rackspace). It's next encoded with different resolutions, bit rates, and formats, optimizing them for the wide variety of devices your students might use to watch it—including iPads, iPhones, Macs, and PCs. Meanwhile, Amazon will put its numerous U.S. and overseas data centers to work. When one of your students streams the lecture, Amazon will cache it at their nearest data center, thereby increasing its speed and availability. In other words, if you have foreign students in Japan watching a lecture you uploaded in North Carolina, Amazon's worldwide reach optimizes everything on the back end to make it play smoothly and quickly.</p>
<h5>Price</h5>
<p>We'll be including a certain amount of file storage free with every Pricing Plan. Small comes with 10GB, Medium gets 50GB, and Large features 100GB. Additional gigabytes will cost $2.50 per month. Our <a href="http://populi.co/pricing/">Pricing</a> page and <a href="http://populi.co/legal/terms/#pricing">Terms of Service</a> have the details.</p>
<p>Here's what you get for that $2.50:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bigger file uploads</li>
<li>Multiple format encoding for video files</li>
<li>Storage and backups on Amazon and Rackspaces's world-class cloud offerings</li>
<li>Optimized streaming and bandwidth baked in</li>
<li>It's all integrated with Populi—there's no setup required to start using it!</li>
</ul>
<p>That $2.50 will be charged on a <em>pro-rata</em> basis—that is, you'll only pay for what you use above your Plan's built-in storage. So, if you upload a 50 Mb file in the last week of a given month, that'd only cost about three cents. Account Admins can monitor how much file storage they're using at any time, and your storage charge, if any, will be itemized on your monthly invoice.</p>
<p><strong>To our current customers</strong>, based on your current file storage, no one will need to pay more—everyone is well below their Plan's file storage allocation.</p>
<h5>The long and the short of it</h5>
<p>No one else offers anything like this, especially not for this price**—media hosting and streaming automatically integrated with your Online Learning software (which, in turn, is integrated with your SIS and Billing software). We think this is a great addition to Populi and a huge step forward for what's available for small schools who want to get serious about online learning.</p>
<blockquote><p>* 1 gigabyte equals 1 billion bytes.</p>
<p>**We looked, we asked around, we did research... and <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/07/nonsense-free-pricing/">just like our SIS competitors</a>, the other companies out there A) won't cough up their pricing and B) require some IT elbow grease to make it work for your school. This assertion is based chiefly on anecdotes from customers who've considered some of these other systems.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p><a href="http://populi.co/about/">We originally built Populi</a> to help a local college replace what small schools typically have to settle for: a creaky old system with Word and Excel tacked on to plug the holes. Since then, lots of other schools have signed on, most of which left another system to get going with us. One way to look at us is as a business that replaces other software.</p>
<p>And if we’ve learned anything from replacing software, it’s that software (like any tool) creates habits in its users—especially software that makes you do too much work. These "habits" aren't limited to individual users, either: sometimes, entire schools shape policies and institutional workflows around the limits of what their old system could do. Policies and workflows that Populi probably transgresses.</p>
<p>Some of this is because Populi obviates the need for these old policies and workflows. In other cases, it gives you a round hole where your old software made you use square pegs. And other times, Populi introduces the "proper" way to do things where previously you had to just kinda, y'know, wing it.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we've found that Populi can disrupt how a college runs itself. Online registration might do away with your enrollment process for incoming freshmen. Your approach to billing could differ from what we intended with tuition schedules. That old "submit grades" spreadsheet just ain’t the same as our gradebook. Bookstore just might be the first real inventory system you've used. And so on...</p>
<p>Populi just <em>isn't</em> what you're currently using, and it's probably gonna rub up against how you're used to running things. So, our exhortation to prospective customers: during the sales process, just dig in!</p>
<p>We'll even give you the shovels...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2010/10/get-to-know-us-heres-nick-holloway/">Nick</a> and <a href="http://populi.co/blog/2011/01/get-to-know-us-heres-joseph-schoolland/">Joseph</a> will do as many <a href="http://populi.co//signup/">live demos</a> as you need.</li>
<li>We’re liberal with logins to our demo site—which has the same codebase as our customers’ sites and the same access to our help desk. Get your faculty and staff to try it out, too.</li>
<li>Ask lots of questions. Ask about the big stuff ("What do you mean by Accounting?"), the seemingly-little stuff ("What does the course catalog mean by 'credits'?"), the technically-arcane stuff ("What's your approach to server replication and redundancy?")—and everything in between.</li>
<li>Nick and Joseph will answer as many phone calls as you can dial and as many emails as you can type. And if you ever stump them, they’ll find someone else here who can help. We want you to be well-informed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dig in! Beyond finding out what Populi does (or does better, or does different), you'll get a sense of where your school has been formed by your current software—and where Populi might hit your pressure points. Of course, we trust that Populi will do a better job for your school than whatever you're using now—in everything from the software to the security to the support. But we simply want you to make the best decision you possibly can, and that includes knowing about the potential sticking points.</p>

		<div class="byline clear">
			
		</div>
		<div class="entry clear">
			<p>In just a few weeks, we're planning to release an overhaul of course instances. From a complete navigation overhaul to some brand-new features to a second look at things we've been doing all along, the upcoming release will make courses a lot more intuitive, useful, and flexible. Have a look at some of the things we're doing:</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Navigation</h5>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/New-Course-Navigation.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2160 aligncenter" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="New Course Navigation" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/New-Course-Navigation.png" alt="" width="510" height="52.8" /></a><br />
Courses are getting our new tab-based navigation, which we're slowly rolling out to all of Populi. As you can see from the screenshot, courses will feature the same basic items—assignments, lessons, gradebook, etc.—and certain actions (finalizing, for instance) will be subsumed under the appropriate tabs. Additionally, who you are will affect where you land when you navigate to a course—registrars and Admins will arrive at the Info tab, and students and faculty will come to the new course Dashboard.</p>
<h5>Dashboard</h5>
<p>The course Dashboard tells faculty and students what's happening now and what's coming up via Alerts, Schedule, Discussions, and a retooled Bulletin Board. Alerts notifies students about upcoming tests, assignments, and currently-available lessons, and informs faculty about test questions that need to be graded. Schedule draws from the new course calendar and displays upcoming course events (due dates, special meeting times, etc.). Discussions summarizes recent activity on course discussions. And the course Bulletin Board is getting updated with file uploads, comments, and a revamped interface.</p>
<h5>Online Learning</h5>
<p>A few new things are in store for online learning. Tests feature new question types—Matching and True/False. Discussions can now be course-wide or attached to a specific Lesson—and you can also attach files and images to comments and replies. And we're making improvements that will make video embedding in Lessons better than ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/Discussions.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2161" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Discussions" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/wp_archive/2011/07/Discussions.png" alt="" width="510" height="612" /></a></p>
<h5>Assignments</h5>
<p>We've created three assignment types to simplify how you use them in your courses. <em>Test</em> assignments will automatically create a corresponding online test. <em>File</em> assignments feature a feed of comments and file uploads so teacher and student can interact about the assignment—they can even pass an essay back and forth with revisions and corrections. And regular assignments will simply be a graded assignment—perfect for things like completed readings.</p>
<h5>Calendar</h5>
<p>The new course calendar lets faculty, registrars, and academic admins add and update course events. Upcoming events display on the course Dashboard, and course calendars are seamlessly integrated with the corresponding calendars on Google Apps.</p>
<h5>Miscellany</h5>
<p>The new reporting tab features the Performance Dashboard and the course Change Log. Cloning and syncing are getting a minor retooling. And, we're also scrubbing the iTunes U integration. Few customers used it (it's probably Apple's clumsiest, most aggravating product)... and we have something much better in store.</p>
