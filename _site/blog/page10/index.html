<p><!--
<p>Coming soon: Campus Life!</p>
<p> --></p>
<p>Campus Life lets staff and student workers add selected fees, manage room and board assignments, and track non-academic violations and consequences (things like parking tickets or student code violations) for anyone at your school. The new features, reports, and workflows help you take care of lots of lower-level tasks so your high-level staff can concentrate on the big picture. Here's a look at Campus Life:</p>
<h5>Room &amp; board</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="width:620px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/room%20occupants%20blog.png" /></p>
<p>Campus Life users can manage room plans and housing assignments for anyone at your school&mdash;everyone from students to visiting professors staying in college residences. The Rooms report gives you a complete look at the housing situation, and the new room management page lets you add occupants and keep notes. Room and meal plans can be managed on the new Profile &gt; Campus Life tab (which syncs this info with the same items on Profile &gt; Financial &gt; By Term). As part of the release, we've also given facilities a new home in Campus Life &gt; Settings.</p>
<h5>Campus Life fees</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="width:620px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/camplife%20fees%20blog.png" /></p>
<p>You can now select certain fees that Campus Life users can apply to students and others at your school. Those fees can be triggered by infractions or added as-needed. Each Campus Life report also includes an <em>Apply Fee</em> action so you can charge students in bulk. Fees are then invoiced as normal by a financial user.</p>
<h5>Violations &amp; Consequences</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="width:620px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/consequence%20violation%20triggers%20blog.png" /></p>
<p>Violations and consequences let you record a student or other person's non-academic infractions. Did a freshman start a ramen fire because she left the saucepan on a hotplate? Drop a room damage fee on her! Has that new assistant coach parked his junky '85 Datsun in the president's spot <em>again</em>? Ding him with a parking ticket! Did that exchange student flout the dress code and dress in cutoff jeans and sleeveless tees all semester long? Time for a visit with the discipline board!</p>
<p>Both violations and consequences can trigger a fee; you can also set up consequences to apply when a student gets a certain number of violations in a given time period. You'll have a full record of the whole thing right on the Profile &gt; Campus Life tab and the new Violations and Consequences reports.</p>
<h5>Get to know Campus Life</h5>
<p>Check out the Campus Life documentation in the <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/forums/23094438">Populi Knowledge Base</a> to get a fuller sense of what it does and how it works.</p>
<p>We're always pleased when we can give our customers something new, and we hope Campus Life helps your school get even more out of Populi!</p>

				<div class="byline clear">
					
				</div>
				<div class="entry clear">
					<p>You're reading this because it is possible to transmit information around the world by making electricity move through melted sand in a particular way.<br />
---<br />
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">Paul Ford</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A computer is a clock with benefits. They all work the same, doing second-grade math, one step at a time: Tick, take a number and put it in box one. Tick, take another number, put it in box two. Tick, <em>operate</em> (an operation might be addition or subtraction) on those two numbers and put the resulting number in box one. Tick, check if the result is zero, and if it is, go to some other box and follow a new set of instructions.</p></blockquote>
<p>The near-infinite possibilities of computing come down to little numbers in little boxes getting added to or subtracted from one another.<br />
---<br />
Because of this basic fact, at its heart, software is as rigidly and uncreatively literal as one of Archimedes' levers, pulleys, or wedges, but made out of electricity that moves in mysterious pulses through melted sand.<br />
---<br />
The near-infinite possibilities contained within a human being&mdash;let alone humanity itself&mdash;are manifestly not the product of little numbers in little boxes being manipulated by basic math.<br />
---<br />
There are two kinds of problems encountered with software. The first is that when software works, mighty labor is involved in making what is essentially a lever, pulley, or wedge communicate meaningfully with a human that skipped breakfast because he was making his infant daughter laugh at him. The second is that when software breaks, it's because at some point, a human skipped breakfast after getting his infant daughter to laugh at him, and then sat down and wrote some code.<br />
---<br />
When you buy software, you're really buying someone's promise that the code he wrote after skipping breakfast to make his infant daughter laugh one more time will reliably, predictably cause the result(s) you're after.<br />
---<br />
When software is broken, the problem is referred to as a bug. That's because a moth once got caught in an old tube-based computer and made the thing stop working.<br />
---<br />
An error message simply means that the command, "[IF A, B, or C happens, THEN produce ERROR message]" worked. That's because software is rigid, literal, and uncreative. When something's wrong, the software doesn't know that. It also doesn't know when anything is right, either. If the power's on, it just goes.<br />
---<br />
A moth's flight is erratic and unpredictable. Software bugs, while appearing to be random and disorderly, are actually predictable and repeatable if you know how to trigger them. They're usually as predictable and repeatable as the parts of the software that are working properly. A bug means that code was successfully executed; it's just that a human wrote code that did something unreliable, undesirable, or unpredictable.<br />
---<br />
We write code and fix bugs in Populi using software that itself has bugs and produces errors. We design Populi around bugs in web browsers, errors in programming languages, and the limitations presented by an extremely literal line of code that must meaningfully communicate with a human who is sleepy from too much breakfast and a night spent comforting an infant daughter with a cold.<br />
---<br />
It's frankly a miracle that anything works at all.</p>

					<p>Ever since we launched Populi, we've included <a href="http://populi.co/about/support">customer support</a> free with every <a href="http://populi.co/pricing">pricing plan</a>. Our schools get help via email, phone, and the Knowledge Base starting the day they sign up and every day following. We've always wanted to make it easy to get answers about Populi.</p>
<p>But some questions come our way that are a bit beyond what we're fit to answer. What's the best way to use Quickbooks for a non-profit? How do you handle access for accreditation staff? What's your policy for online course attendance? And so on. These are questions not so much about Populi as they are about the best way to run your school (and how Populi fits into that). On those matters, we like to defer to the experts: other users. Among our hundreds of customers, we have schools with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and missions&mdash;and, we're sure, someone who has puzzled through your very problem and now has wisdom to share.</p>
<p>You can seek out that wisdom&mdash;and share your own&mdash;on the <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/forums/71392">Populi User Forum</a>. The Forum lets our users pose questions about best practices, school policies, workflow ideas, and so on&mdash;basically, anything having to do with running your school (including how to use Populi to make that happen). We encourage you to get on the Forum; a simple way to keep an eye on it is to subscribe to email updates. These will alert you to new topics, comments, and replies. Here's how to subscribe:</p>
<h5>1. Go to the Knowledge Base</h5>
<p>Click the orange help button in the upper right corner of Populi. Or, go to <a href="https://support.populiweb.com">Populi Support</a> and log in with your regular Populi login credentials and your school's Populi URL.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/orange%20help.png" style="width:300px;" height="107px;" /></p>
<h5>2. Go to the User Forum</h5>
<p>In the right column of the Populi Support landing page, you'll see a list of Forums. Click <em>User Forums</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/user%20forum%20link.png" style="width:250px;" height="196px;" /></p>
<p>You'll then see links to the User Forum and the Feature Request Forum. Click the <em>User Forum</em> heading.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/user%20forum%20link%202.png" style="width:615px;" height="142px;" /></p>
<h5>3. Subscribe!</h5>
<p>Near the top of the screen, you'll see a subscribe link. Click it, and you'll be subscribed&mdash;that's it! Now, whenever someone posts or updates a new topic or comment, you'll receive a message about it at the email address marked <em>Primary</em> on your Populi profile.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/subscribe%20to%20forum.png" style="width:420px;" height="135px;" /></p>
<p>Of course, everyone here is keeping an eye on the User Forum, too. We think it's a great opportunity for our users to help each other out and learn more about making Populi do the most for your school.</p>

				<h3 class="displayMedium"><a href="/blog/financial-aid-workflow-updates" rel="bookmark" title="Financial aid workflow updates">Financial aid workflow updates</a></h3>
				<div class="byline clear">
					
				</div>
				<div class="entry clear">
					<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog%20financial%20aid%20settings%20general.png" style="width:630px;" /></p>
<p>Our new financial release gives Financial Aid its own General Settings section and introduces some new, more flexible workflows. Here's a look:</p>
<h5>Refunds</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog%20Refund%20credit%20balance%20SB%20all.png" style="width:380px;" /></p>
<p>A new setting now lets Student Billing and Financial Admin users refund financial aid to students. When you check <em>Yes</em> on the new setting, the <em>Refund to Student</em> workflow is folded in under your options in the new <em>Refund Credit Balance</em> workflow on Profile &gt; Financial &gt; Dashboard. An additional new setting lets you configure your Aid Refund Policy&mdash;if you need to combine aid refunds with regular credit balance refunds, for example, you now have that option.</p>
<p>The new setting is a one-way, opt-in setting; once you enable it, you're upgraded to the new, improved workflow (for keeps!). It's a considerable improvement to the old batch workflow, and it will definitely take some work off your Financial Aid department's desk. Read about it in the <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/entries/96221248">Populi Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
<h5>Refund Credit Balance</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog%20refund%20credit%20balance.png" style="width:334px;" /></p>
<p>With all this talk of a new <em>Refund Credit Balance</em> workflow, we thought it'd be helpful to tell you what we're talking about.</p>
<p>Formerly, non-aid refunds to students were handled as an outgoing payment. There were some problems with this. For starters, most folks didn't think to look for the <em>refund</em> workflow under the <em>Record Payment</em> option. It also only let you refund regular payments&mdash;it didn't touch aid refunds to students, which are handled by many schools' student billing departments.</p>
<p>The new Refund Credit Balance option now appears whenever the student has something refundable&mdash;an unapplied payment or credit, or unapplied aid (if you've updated the aforementioned setting). The steps are just the same as the old workflow, with numerous provisions for the <em>Aid Refund Policy</em> setting. It's more intuitive, and what's more, the option only appears in the actions menu if there's something refundable on the student's account. It's an improvement not just for Financial Aid, but your Student Billing office as well. Read more about the new <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/entries/96264628">Refund Credit Balance workflow</a>.</p>
<h5>Batch workflow order</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/blog%20disburse%20or%20draw.png" style="width:334px;" /></p>
<p>The <em>Disbursement batch workflow</em> setting lets you specify which comes first: disbursing aid to students or drawing down the funds from the aid source. If your school is required to disburse-then-draw-down for Federal aid awards, you can now set up your batch workflow to follow the same steps in the same order you do.</p>

				<h3 class="displayMedium"><a href="/blog/better-fee-rules-and-other-financial-improvements" rel="bookmark" title="Better fee rules and other financial improvements">Better fee rules and other financial improvements</a></h3>
				<div class="byline clear">
					
				</div>
				<div class="entry clear">
					<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/Fee%20rules%20blog.png" style="width:950px;" /></p>
<p>Fee rules let you set up conditions that automatically trigger a fee when a student enrolls in a course. You can target them at things like enrollments, audits, campuses, custom info, and so on.</p>
<p>Handy as they are, fee rules haven't always proved flexible enough to target complex situations. It was pretty difficult, for example, to make a fee trigger when students in the Graduate program enrolled in LIT576 at <em>either</em> the Springfield Campus <em>or</em> the Urbana Campus&mdash;such either/or situations required multiple fees with different rules.</p>
<p>Our new fee rules (just released last night!) handle these situations with aplomb. Rules now exist within <em>rule groups</em>; you can have multiple rule groups for each fee. Rule groups include an "any/all" selector that lets you specify your conditions with greater clarity. If you use multiple rule groups, you can easily set up conditions that bill students who "all fit this situation <em>and</em> either this or that other situation". That means it's now simple to set up a fee that triggers when an Undergraduate student enrolls in 1 to 18 credits at <em>either</em> the Portland Campus <em>or</em> the Online Campus (like the above image).</p>
<p>In addition to rule groups, we've added new rules that let you distinguish between <em>all</em> of a student's enrolled units and those enrolled units that <em>match</em> your other conditions. To learn more, check out our <a href="https://support.populiweb.com/entries/52514">detailed Knowledge Base article</a> that describes how fees work.</p>
<p>Here are some of the other financial improvements we've released in the recent weeks and months...</p>
<h5>Improved financial dashboard summary</h5>
<p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/Pay%20now%20summary%20blog.png" style="width:400px;" /></p>
<p>The student's financial dashboard summary is now headlined by a big fat <em>Make a Payment</em> button that shows the student's amount due (plus any overdue amount). Upcoming payment due dates (whether for invoices or payment plans) are clearly lined out together with any pending financial aid payments.</p>
<h5>Invoice due dates</h5>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/Edit%20invoice%20due%20date%20blog.png" style="width:720px;" /></p>
<p>Lots of people asked for this: you can now edit invoice due dates! Just go to the invoice's info page and click the pencil next to the due date in the right column.</p>
<h5>Recurring payment management</h5>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media.populi.co/Recurring%20payment%20manage%20blog.png" style="width:720px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://populi.co/blog/2015/05/recurring-donations/">Last May</a> we added the ability to set up recurring donations and payments. A recent updated gives you more options for managing those payments. You can now change the amount, schedule, and payment details on both the payer's profile and the Recurring Payments/Donations reports.</p>
