            <p>Date of Last Revision: August 14, 2019</p>

            <p>
                Welcome to Populi! We, Populi, Inc., (&#8220;Populi&#8221;) provide our college management system and related services through our website located at www.populiweb.com (our &#8220;Site&#8221;) and our mobile device applications (&#8220;Apps&#8221;). We also make our system and related services available through our customers&#8217; websites (&#8220;Customer Sites&#8221;). Please read these Terms carefully because they govern your use of our Services (as defined below).
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8220;Plain-language&#8221; summaries (<em>&#8220;This means that&#8230;&#8221;</em> sections) are provided for your convenience and are not legally binding. Make sure you read these Customer Terms of Service for the complete terms of your institution&#8217;s relationship to Populi.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Section 1: Terms of Service
            </h4>
            <div class="plain_language">
                <p><strong>This means that&#8230;</strong></p>
                <p>
                    By signing up your school for a Populi Customer Account, you bind your school to the terms described in these Customer Terms of Service (CTOS). Sometimes we&#8217;ll update Populi, and these CTOS covers those updates, too. We may also need to update these CTOS, and we&#8217;ll let you know when we do. Additionally, these CTOS bind anyone at your school who uses Populi to our Authorized Use Policy (AUP).

            <h5>
                1.1 About these Terms:
            </h5>
            <p>
                These Terms (including our <a href="/legal/aup/">Acceptable Use Policy</a>) apply to our education institution customers (&#8220;Customers&#8221;) which have engaged Populi to provide our college management system and related services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of our Services by our Customers&#8217; Authorized Users is governed by our Acceptable Use Policy. A Customer&#8217;s &#8220;Authorized Users&#8221; are persons who have been granted access by the Customer to access and use the Services via a unique login (a username and password). Authorized Users include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Employees and consultants (including teachers and administrators)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prospective, enrolled, and former students
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any other users of the Customer Site who have been granted user access by the Customer
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>
                1.2 Agreement to Terms:
            </h5>            
            <p>
                By establishing a Customer Account (as defined below), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don&#8217;t agree to these Terms, do not use the Services. You are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or education institution (such as your employer) or other legal entity, and consequently you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. &#8220;You&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221; will refer to that company or other legal entity.
            </p>
            <h5>
                1.3 Changes to Terms:
            </h5>
            <p>
                We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we&#8217;ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It&#8217;s important that you review the modified Terms because if you continue to use the Services after we&#8217;ve let you know that the Terms have been modified, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don&#8217;t agree to be bound by the modified Terms then you may no longer use the Services.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Section 2: Populi Account Set-Up
            </h4>
            <div class="plain_language">
                <p><strong>This means that&#8230;</strong></p>
                <p>
                    So your school can use Populi, you need to set up a Populi Customer Account. Your users will need to have Populi User Accounts in order to use Populi.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                To use the Services, including enabling us to implement and operate your instance of the Services, you&#8217;ll have to create a Populi customer account (your &#8220;Customer Account&#8221;). To create a Customer Account, you must complete the Populi Customer Account Signup process.
            </p>    
            <p>    
                In addition, each of your Authorized Users will have to create a unique Populi user account to use certain features of the Services, including
                the Populi section of your Customer Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of the Customer Account signup process, and from time to time via the Services, you will designate one or more of your Authorized Users as your &#8220;Account Admin(s)&#8221; or &#8220;Billing Contact(s)&#8221;. &#8220;Account Admins&#8221; can access and manage all aspects of your Customer Account and your Customer Content (defined below)<!--via the &#8220;Account&#8221; section of the Customer Site/!-->. "Billing Contacts" (and others whom you may specify) will be notified concerning invoices for payments owed to Populi.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree and acknowledge that each user login may only be used by one (1) person and sharing of user logins (including passwords) is not
                permitted. You may create separate logins, and designate as many Authorized Users as are necessary for the effective use of the Services. You
                will not create a login to the Services for, or otherwise provide access to the Services to, any representative(s) of any competing software
                distributor or vendor.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to maintain our own logins and user accounts for your Customer Site in order to provide the Services, including to assist
                with your support requests.

            <h5>
                6.1 Pricing
            </h5>
            <p>
                Pricing consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A monthly fee (the &#8220;Base Rate&#8221;)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A monthly per-Billable Student fee (the &#8220;Student Price&#8221;) where &#8220;Billable Students&#8221; are all students (whether
                    full-time, part-time, or auditing) who are enrolled in at least 1 of your courses for 7 or more calendar days in a given calendar month (or in a course that lasts for 7 or fewer calendar days), including any Populi user accounts you created for testing purposes (e.g. a fictitious student created for testing purposes).
                </li>
                <li>
                    A monthly allotment of free data storage capacity with respect to data or other Content uploaded to the Services by or on behalf
                    of you and your Authorized Users in any month (&#8220;File Storage&#8221;)
                </li>    
                <li>
                    A monthly allotment of free Text Messages. Each such free Text Message enables you to send 1 Text Message of up to 140 bytes to 1 text notification number without charge. For example, if you send 1 Text Message to 100 text notification numbers, that counts as 100 Text Messages. Messages over 140 bytes will count as more than one Text Message. Text Messages do not roll over from one month to the next
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>6.2 Fees Payable by You</h5>
            <p>
            You will pay us the following fees on a monthly basis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Base Rate:</strong> You will pay the Base Rate for every month beginning as of the date your instance of the Services is implemented (i.e., the date your unique instance of the Services (your Populi website) is available via your Customer Site).

                <li>
                    <strong>Student Fee:</strong> You will pay the Student Fee every month beginning as of the date your instance of the Services is implemented (i.e., the date your unique instance of the Services (your Populi website) is available via your Customer Site). The &#8220;Student Fee&#8221;, payable by you in any month, is equal to the number Billable Students from the previous month multiplied by the Student Price.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>File Storage Charge:</strong> If the data or other Content uploaded to the Services by or on behalf of you and your Authorized Users in any month exceeds the allotment of free File Storage, you will pay a pro-rata &#8220;File Storage Charge&#8221; with respect to such excess data according to our then-current published File Storage rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Text Messaging Charge:</strong> If the number of Text Messages sent by you in any month exceeds the allotment of free Text Messages, you will pay a &#8220;Text Messaging Charge&#8221; with respect to each such excess Text Message according to our then-current published Text Messaging rates.

            </p>
            <p>
                You will pay all amounts payable under these Terms in U.S. dollars and in full, without deductions of any kind (including for taxes or duties or bank or other fees). You are solely responsible for, and will promptly pay, all taxes and duties of any kind (including but not limited to sales, use and withholding taxes) associated with these Terms or your or your Authorized Users&#8217; use of the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will pay all amounts payable under these Terms upon receipt of the invoice. Any payment or portion thereof not received by us before the next invoice date shall be considered &#8220;Late&#8221;. Late payments will incur interest at a rate of 3% per month, or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is lower (&#8220;Late Fees&#8221;).
