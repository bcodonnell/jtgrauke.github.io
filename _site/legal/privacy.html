            </p>
            <p>
                Protecting your privacy is really important to us. Accordingly, we&#8217;re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding
                the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive when you use the Services (as defined in our <a href="/legal/terms/">Terms of
                Service</a> and <a href="/legal/aup/">Acceptable Use Policy</a>). This Privacy Policy applies only to those websites, services, and applications
                included within the &#8220;Services&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t apply to any other third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they
                are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in
                this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8220;Plain-language&#8221; summaries (<em>&#8220;This means that&#8230;&#8221;</em> sections) are provided for your convenience and are not legally binding. Make sure you read this Privacy Policy for the complete details of how Populi handles your information.

                About this Privacy Policy
            </h4>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Services, including our &#8220;Customers&#8221; and our Customer&#8217;s &#8220;Authorized
                Users&#8221;.

                <p>
                    We collect certain information from Customers when they set up a Customer Account. We only use this information to provide the Services to you. If you cancel your Customer Account, we may retain some of your information for internal uses&mdash;but we will not sell it or otherwise use it.

                This section of the Privacy Policy applies to information that Populi collects from our Customers.

            <h5>
                1.1 How do we collect and use information from Customers?
            </h5>
            <p>
                Our goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Populi
                customer account (&#8220;Customer Account&#8221;)), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you create a Customer Account we&#8217;ll collect certain information that can be used to identify and contact you, such as your name,
                email address, mailing address, and phone number. As indicated in Section 2 below, similar information will be collected from the individual
                employees designated as Customer &#8220;account administrators&#8221;, &#8220;billing contacts&#8221;, or other Authorized Users.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use this information to provide the Services to our Customers and their Authorized Users.
            </p>
            <h5>
                1.2 Modifying or Deleting Your Information
            </h5>
            <p>
                If you are using the Services in your capacity as a Customer, you can access and modify certain information associated with your Customer
                Account via your Customer Account. If you want to delete any such information, you should contact us at support@populi.co with your
                request. We&#8217;ll take steps to delete the applicable information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in
                archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Section 2: Authorized Users
            </h5>
            <div class="plain_language">
                <p><strong>This means that&#8230;</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We collect certain personally-identifying information from our Customer's Authorized Users. We only use this information to provide the
                    Services to our Customers and their users and also to learn how you use Populi. Most of the information is collected by our Customers so
                    they can run their school. If you want to remove your information from the Customer's Populi site, you&#8217;ll need to contact the Customer. Even if it&#8217;s removed, we may retain some of your information for internal uses&mdash;but we will not sell it or otherwise use it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                This section of the Privacy Policy applies to information that Populi may receive about Authorized Users.
            </p>
            <h5>
                2.1 How do we obtain and use information about Authorized Users?
            </h5>
            <p>
                Our goals in using information about Authorized Users are to provide and improve the Services, to administer your use of the Services
                (including your Populi user account (&#8220;Account&#8221;)), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                In connection with your user account, you provide certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address,
                mailing address, phone number, vaccination records, and education records (including course enrollment and performance data), and in some
                cases your social security number (&#8220;Personally Identifiable Information&#8221; or &#8220;PII&#8221;). You may also be asked to provide
                certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as your gender, date of birth, ethnicity,
                marital status, and zip code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most PII we receive with respect to Authorized Users is collected by and held on behalf of our Customers. If you are an Authorized User, you
                acknowledge and agree that any PII or other information that you provide to the Customer via the Services is received, used, and processed
                by us and our third party service providers on behalf of the applicable Customer in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This information is generally collected via your Account when you use the Services, pursuant to the applicable Customer&#8217;s information
                collection practices, which are typically outlined in a privacy policy like this one and made available on the Customer&#8217;s website. We
                encourage all Authorized Users to read the privacy policies or statements of the applicable Customer and other online services they access
                or use.
            </p>
            <p>
                We analyze and use this information to provide the Services to our Customers and their Authorized Users.
            </p>
            <h5>
                2.2 Modifying or Deleting Your Information
            </h5>
            <p>
                If you are an Authorized User, you can access certain of the PII associated with your Account via your Account. In order to access and
                modify the PII associated with your Account however, you must contact the Customer directly. If instructed by our Customer, we&#8217;ll take
                steps to delete the applicable information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our
                records or as otherwise required by law.

                2.3 Communications from Populi
            </h5>
            <p>
                The Services may include certain communications to Account-holders from Populi, such as administrative messages; these communications are
                considered part of Populi and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them.
            </p>
            <h5>

            </h5>

                notifications and campus alerts, from the Customer where you are employed, engaged or enrolled. You can opt-out of this service at any time
                via your Account.

                    Services to our Customers and their users and also to learn how you use Populi. Most of the information is collected by our Customers so

            <p>
                The remainder of this Privacy Policy applies to information that Populi may receive about any users of the Services, including both Account
                holders (including Customers &amp; Authorized Users) and non-Account holders (each a &#8220;User&#8221;).

                3.1 Personally Identifiable Information
            </h5>
            <p>
                We may collect PII through our Site when you provide it to us in order to schedule a demo or request to receive our newsletter.

            <h5>
                3.2 Information Collected Using Cookies
            </h5>
            <p>
                We collect certain information through the use of &#8220;cookies,&#8221; which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you
                access the Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you&#8217;ve logged in to the Services and to
                tell us how and when you interact with the Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the
                Services and to customize and improve the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the
                Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop
                automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don&#8217;t accept cookies, you
                may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage may also place their
                own cookies on your browser, some of which may connect to third-party advertisers (we do not knowingly connect to any third-party
                advertisers). Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.
            </p>
            <h5>
                3.3 Information Related to Use of the Services
            </h5>
            <p>
                Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses the Services (we refer to this information as &#8220;Log
                Data&#8221;). Log Data may include information such as a User&#8217;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web
                page that a User was visiting before accessing the Services, the pages or features of the Services to which a User browsed and the time
                spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on the Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. If you are an Account
                holder, Log Data about you is connected to and used in conjunction with your Account. We use this information to administer the Services and
                we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and
                functionality and tailoring them to our Users&#8217; needs and preferences. We may use a person&#8217;s IP address to fight spam, malware and
                identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how the Services are used.
            </p>
            <h5>
                3.4 Communications from Populi
            </h5>
            <p>
                We may use your PII to contact you with Populi newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that you have
                specifically requested from us. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the
                unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
            </p>

Their access to your information is limited to what they need to perform services on our behalf. Sometimes we&#8217;ll share information in aggregate form (i.e. "We serve 20,000 students!"). If necessary, we might have to disclose information to comply with the law or to protect people or property.
