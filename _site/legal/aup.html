            <h3>Populi Acceptable Use Policy For All Populi Users</h3>

            <p>Date of Last Revision: April 1, 2013</p>

            <p>
                Welcome to Populi! We, Populi, Inc., (&#8220;Populi&#8221;) provide our college management system and related services through our website
                located at www.populi.co (our &#8220;Site&#8221;) and our mobile device application (&#8220;App&#8221;). We also make our system and related
                services available through our customers&#8217; websites (&#8220;Customer Sites&#8221;). Please read this Acceptable Use Policy (the
                &#8220;AUP&#8221;) carefully because it governs your use of our Services. To make this AUP easier to read, our Site, App and services are
                collectively called the &#8220;Services&#8221;.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8220;Plain-language&#8221; summaries (<em>&#8220;This means that&#8230;&#8221;</em> sections) are provided for your convenience and are not legally binding. Make sure you read this Acceptable Use Policy for the complete terms of your relationship to Populi.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Section 1: About this AUP
            </h4>
            <div class="plain_language">
                <p><strong>This means that&#8230;</strong></p>
                <p>
                    By using Populi, you agree to the terms described in this Authorized Use Policy. Sometimes we&#8217;ll update Populi, and this AUP covers those updates, too. We may also need to update this AUP, and we&#8217;ll let you know when we do.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                This AUP applies to all users of the Services, including our Customers and their Authorized Users.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8220;Customers&#8221; are our education institution customers which have engaged Populi to provide the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of our Services by our Customers&#8217; Authorized Users is governed by our Acceptable Use Policy. A Customer&#8217;s &#8220;Authorized Users&#8221; are persons who have been granted access by the Customer to access and use the Services via a unique login (a username and password). Authorized
                Users include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Employees and consultants (including teachers and administrators)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prospective, enrolled, and former students
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any other users of the Customer Site who have been granted user access by the Customer
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>
                1.2 Agreement to this AUP
            </h5>
            <p>
                By using the Services, you agree to be bound by this AUP. If you don&#8217;t agree to this AUP, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or education institution (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to this AUP. In that case, &#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221; will refer to that company or other legal entity.
            </p>
            <h5>
                1.3 Changes to AUP or Services
            </h5>
            <p>
                We may modify this AUP at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we&#8217;ll let you know either by posting the modified AUP on the Site or other communications. It&#8217;s important that you review the modified AUP because if you continue to use the Services after we&#8217;ve let you know that the AUP has been modified, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified AUP. If you don&#8217;t agree to be bound by the modified AUP then you may no longer use the Services. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Section 2: User Account Setup
            </h4>
            <div class="plain_language">
                <p><strong>This means that&#8230;</strong></p>
                <p>
                    To use Populi, you&#8217;ll need a user account. User accounts are created and managed by your school&#8217;s staff. You&#8217;ll need an email address that&#8217;s not directly connected to Populi so we can send you messages about your user account.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In order to use certain features of the Services, you will need a user account (&#8220;User Account&#8221;). Customers are responsible for
                creating, maintaining, blocking, suspending, and revoking all User Accounts at their respective Customer Sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree that you won&#8217;t disclose your User Account password to anyone and you&#8217;ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of     your User Account.
            </p>
            <p>
                All users must maintain a &#8220;third-party email address&#8221; to which we can send notifications related to the Services. A third-party
                email address is any email address that is not directly accessed through the Services and is not dependent on the Services to authenticate the
                user. For example, a Google Apps email address created through the Services is not a third-party email address.
            </p>

                <p>
                    You should read our Privacy Policy so you understand what information we collect from you and how we use it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Please refer to our <a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for information on how we collect, use, and disclose information from our users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authorized Users should be aware that we will collect or maintain on behalf of each of our Customers certain personally identifiable information (including education records) about or related to such Customer&#8217;s Authorized Users (collectively &#8220;Authorized User Data&#8221;). We will use the Authorized User Data only to provide the Services to the applicable Customer.
            </p>

                Section 4: Content and Content Rights
            </h4>
            <div class="plain_language">

You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by Populi on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                You understand that you are providing your User Content (including Authorized User Data) to us for the benefit of the specific Customer where you are currently or were formerly employed, engaged, enrolled, or applying to be enrolled. As such you agree that:

            <p>
                A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
                (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired
                judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&#8217;s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

                10.5 Arbitration Location and Procedure
            </h5>
            <p>
                Unless you and Populi otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Latah County, Idaho. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Populi submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

                The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&#8217;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&#8217;s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the &#8220;Limitation of Liability&#8221; section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&#8217;s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. If Populi prevails in arbitration, we will be entitled to an award of attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.

                claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Populi will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

                    This AUP defines our relationship. If either you or us differ on something, we&#8217;ll both appeal to this AUP to figure it out. You can&#8217;t give your rights and responsibilities described here to someone else without our permission, but we may transfer our obligations to another party if we need to (say, we sell the company).

                This AUP constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Populi and you regarding the Services and Content, and this
                AUP supersedes and replaces any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Populi and you regarding the Services and
                Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are accessing the Services on behalf of a company or education institution (such as your
                employer) or other legal entity, this AUP does not supersede or replace any other agreements in place between Populi and such company, education institution, or other legal entity. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this AUP invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this AUP will remain in full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not assign or transfer this AUP, by operation of law or otherwise, without Populi&#8217;s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to
                assign or transfer this AUP, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Populi may freely assign or transfer this AUP without
                restriction. Subject to the foregoing, this AUP will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

            <p>
                Any notices or other communications provided by Populi under this AUP, including those regarding modifications to this AUP, will be given:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    (i) Via email; For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted

            <p>
                Populi&#8217;s failure to enforce any right or provision of this AUP will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Populi. Except as expressly set forth in this AUP, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this AUP will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this AUP or otherwise.
